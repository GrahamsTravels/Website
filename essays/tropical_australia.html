        <p>	I arrived in Australia in the far north, in Cairns, on the Cape York Peninsula which stretches into tropical seas towards New Guinea. The airport here is the farthest north on the east coast that will receive international flights. Cairns isn’t much to speak of, a little port town and tourist jumping off point; flat and boring. It’s what surrounds the city that attracts myself and over one million tourists each year: the reef and the rainforest.</p>
        <p>Less than a week after I arrived, I pulled off to the side of the road to spend some time on the phone with my extended family, finding just a sliver of good service. It’s just a Friday morning in north Queensland, but Thanksgiving dinner back home. One of the questions I get is what does Australia look like, they expect answers that fit with the Australia of our imaginations. The foreign land of never ending desert expanses, of gnarly trees beaten town by the wind atop cliffs overlooking spectacular beaches. The spectacular beaches are here, but the rest of Australia’s stereotypical terrain is not. “Really green” is the best response I can give. Tropical Australia does not look like most of the continent, it resembles Indonesia and Southeast Asia with deep jungles, the farther north you get the greener it becomes. Most of this continent is dry, arid at best, desert at worst. But far north Queensland is a land of rainy seasons and dry seasons, and even dry seasons likely bring daily rain if only for a few hours rather than all day.</p>

        <p>The main attraction here is that most famous of reefs, the Great Barrier one. Cairns is an easy access point, and a spot where the edge of the reef, which offers the best wildlife viewing, is a shorter distance from shore. Easy accessible on a day tour to snorkel or dive. </p>

        <p>People flock to the reef to see mysterious turtles scavenging along the seafloor. Fluttering schools of little bright blue, red and green fish swimming among the corals, like neon lights within the sea. Unicorn fish with their pronounced foreheads like something prehistoric. The large parrot fish with their powerful beaks, they can be heard as well as seen. A pause in breathing will allow you to hear them eating the coral, an opera of crunching. Needlefish and flutemouths, thin little shimmers only visible from some angles as narrow lines of silvery light. Solitary clownfish (or Nemos as they are now called in the post-Pixar world) struggling to keep their position in the current. Yet for all the beautiful wildlife, there is some danger, here there be dragons.</p>
        <p>These dragons are quite small though, they are the box jellyfish, or ‘stingers.’ The blue bottles, Portuguese Man o’ Wars, large, dangerous and famous. Or chironex fleckeri, with enough venom to stop a heart within four minutes. But those stingers are large enough to notice and have stings painful enough that you know when something has gone wrong. It’s the irukandji that scare me the most: translucent and no bigger than a thumbnail, they are practically invisible while swimming. Their stings feel like nothing more than a mosquito bite, you wouldn’t even notice it. Only after a half hour would you start to feel something amiss. Pain across the body, nausea, difficulty breathing, and most terrifyingly “an impending sense of doom.” It’s known as Irukandji syndrome, more like a mysterious disease than an animal sting. It’s the shock that kills you, pain rather than toxins. They infest the waters of Northern Australia during the summer months. Bathers wear wet suits to ward off the stings, some will swim with socks and hoods to limit the amount of exposed skin (all this is probably worthwhile for sun protection too, Cairns like many places is Australia claims itself “the skin cancer capital of the world”). On some beaches there is netting protecting patches of ocean to swim in. Although, the meshing is fairly large, six inch gaps. Good to stop the larger box jellies, but worthless against the irukandji. It seems that to see the most beautiful sights there must always be some risk involved.</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p>A couple hours north of Cairns lies the Daintree rainforest. Rainforests cover much of northern Queensland, but it’s the Daintree that is the crown jewel. This is where the forest is the most unscathed, where life is richest. You have to take a small car ferry to cross into the heart of the forest, just a flat barge pulled across by metal cords. </p>
        <p>It’s an ancient forest, prehistoric, pre-human, even pre-large mammal. For over 100 million years this area of land has remained around the tropics, spared the global journeys of plate tectonics. This relative latitudinal consistency has allowed the rainforest to flourish since the time of the dinosaurs. Even if the dinosaurs are gone, these are the forests walked by the dinosaurs. Many of the plant species date back to that era, or at least close relatives of species that did. And maybe the dinosaurs themselves haven’t fully left. The most famous animal of Australia’s rainforests are human-sized birds, the cassowary. With towering head ridges, bright blue and red necks, and 5-inch claws on their feet, these birds don’t seem too far off from the dinosaurs that were their distant ancestors. It’s not hard to imagine cassowaries are closer in the evolutionary tree to their reptilian ancestors than other modern birds. Evolution may move slower here, lacking climate shifts to spur it.</p>

        <p>The biodiversity in Daintree is just as rich as on the reef, but it’s much harder to spot. You can hear plenty of it though, the forest is loud. Buzzing insects, croaking frogs, singing birds, the forest seems bursting with life just out of sight. Part of the challenge of spotting wildlife is that you don’t know where to look. Do you try to spot tree kangaroos and pythons lying in the upper reaches of the canopy or look under leaves for brightly-colored tree frogs? The only animals that are immediately apparent are spiders who build their webs across the trail. You have to keep your eyes in front too so you don’t walk right through them. In a country known for poisonous animals, walking through a spiderweb brings a surge of fear.</p>
        <p>The biggest challenge in finding the fauna is the flora. Rainforests are as dense with vegetation as their reputations would predict. Greenery that overlaps so thoroughly that the forest seems almost impenetrable beyond ten feet. I never spotted a cassowary, but they might have been just out of sight, less than a 100 feet into the jungle. And the plants don't just hide the animals, they distract from them too. Nowhere is plant life as interesting as in the rainforest. Basket ferns sit among the upper reaches of almost every tree, looking like potted plants nestled among branches. When you get up high enough to see the canopy almost every tree seems to have three or more leaf types coming out of the top of it. Vines are abundant, spiraling from the forest floor up the towering tree trunks. Mangrove groves near the beach have elaborate roots to hold themselves upright on flooded soil. Epiphytes lie wistfully on branches. Even the smaller plants here have great potential, some saplings will remain only a few feet tall for up to twenty years, waiting for a gap in the canopy. Then, they will rapidly shoot up when they have their chance at sunlight. Most of the popular trails here are boardwalks, needed to keep the forest at bay enough to enjoy it. </p>

        <p>The beaches here are beautiful, and a nice way to get a break and a view that goes beyond 100 feet. The forest-covered mountains crescendo down into the water. These beaches are for walking but not for swimming, every beach has a sign warning of deadly crocodiles and stingers, complete with a bottle of vinegar for use in an emergency. They make a great spot of camping too, and one that doesn’t spare you the “pleasures” of the rainforest. The beach air is light and breezy, but just a few feet past the tree line the heat and humidity come into play, the air feels so thick you could cut it with a knife. I go without a sleeping bag and leave the rainfly off, hoping for some reprieve. I do know the rainfly will have to come back on at some point though, never a dry night in the tropics. Some raindrops will awaken me in the night and I’ll jump up to toss the rainfly on as quickly as possible. As I try to fall asleep I hear the rustling of rodents and flightless birds walking around the tent, the forest never sleeps.</p>

        <p>After camping in Daintree I started driving south. Waterfalls a plenty mark road trip maps in this land of mountains and heavy rains. The greatest are Wallaman Falls, a nearly 900 foot drop off a sheer cliff, the highest single drop of any falls in Australia. These falls are truly off the beaten track, over an hour and a half from the A1 highway. The time commitment is less because of the distance traveled and more because of the nature of the driving. After driving through farm fields (including those with cows just sitting in the middle of the road), the road climbs through windy switchbacks. Steep and narrow with sharp curves, it feels necessary to give the horn a beep when going around a blind turn, even while creeping along at barely 10 kilometers an hour. As treacherous and time-consuming as the drive is, it gets you away from crowds, tour buses could never make it up that road. And it rewards with the spectacular view from up top as you can see the water careening down the cliff, falling into a deep pit as much as a valley.</p>

        <p>The real treat comes from descending down the ridge to get a closer view. The thin forest of the cliff top quickly disappears, replaced by the lush rainforest that gets thicker and thicker as you descend. At the bottom, you see the falls from a new angle staring upwards at the water. The ferocious current seems to fall in slow motion and weakens quickly, diminishing into mists before it hits the bottom. The mist refreshingly blows in towards you, covering the whole area in a faint dampness. There is a pool at the bottom of the falls, but calling it a swimming hole might be a stretch. Putting your head under the falls would probably be a less refreshing and more painful experience. Even getting to the waterline is a struggle. I watch some young tourists trek across the stone piles, making slow progress as they take 30 minutes to go a few hundred feet. Doesn’t really seem worth it, I’ll just enjoy the view.</p>

        <p>I spend the night up on the same ridge that houses Wallaman falls, finding a little campsite on Google maps. There’s just a few buildings, a shelter / kitchen and bathrooms / showers, and a little gap in the wall to pay the fee. Beyond just one other camper (a local), the only company is wildlife. A rich variety of birds, giant fruit bats and the stars of the show: a small herd of wallabies (smaller relatives to kangaroos, which I initially mistake for kangaroos thinking wallabies is just a nickname). They hop around playfully and put on a little show boxing. Even the wallabies understand you need to give tourists what they want.</p>
        <p>The next day I stayed on the ridge far from the main tourist drags. I take a little hike to see another set of waterfalls, this time from the top rather than the bottom. The hike quickly enters the rainforest. I had wondered what tramping through the forest would be like without the luxury of a boardwalk, now’s my chance. Initially, it’s type 1 fun to be enclosed by the dense foliage, but quickly transitions to the type 2 variety. It’s less walking than weaving through the vines and fallen logs. It’s hard, sweaty work with hot and humid air sitting in the woods without a breeze. There’s a spiny vine that becomes a continual issue (calamus australis) as it grabs onto clothes, bags and skin, locally known as “wait-a-whiles” because you will be waiting a while as you work yourself free. You can easily understand the value that a machete has when trekking through the jungle. It’s easy to lose the trail and I have to retrace my steps more than a few times. Often I stare confused looking one way then the other for a hint of a trail. The view from the falls is rewarding primarily as a reprieve from this labyrinth, and a chance to rip leeches off my legs. Hiking in the jungle, disorienting, difficult, and exhausting. Check that box at least. And I wasn’t even in that deep of a rainforest, just a small one sitting on a mountain.</p>

        <p>After driving down from the ridge I make my way back to the coast, some tourist beaches sound nice then, and continue on south. The farther south you drive through Queensland the more it looks like that mental image of Australia. Dry grasslands and skinny trees stretching in all directions. At times, you see scorch marks on tree trunks, intentional controlled burns being a good way to prevent more destructive bushfires. The gaps between any semblance of civilization can be over an hour at times, with only cattle in between. Once you reach Brisbane the rainforests are gone beyond some small pockets. The water is safer to swim in some ways, the deadly box jellies don’t venture this far south, but more dangerous in other ways as the reef no longer protects the coast. The strong current and large waves are better for surfing than for bathing. This is the Australia of the imagination, and it only appears halfway down the coast. </p>
