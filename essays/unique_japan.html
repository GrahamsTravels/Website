        <p>It wasn’t until I left Japan that I appreciated how fully unique Japan is, a culture completely distinctive from all others. When I arrived in Seoul after a month in Japan I was a bit shocked by how different Korea was, the closest country to Japan in both a cultural and a geographical sense, yet it felt like a different world. More westernized of course, but also more Asian. Korea has a bit of the mess and chaos that can be found in Asia, traffic is busy and loud, although traffic rules are still followed, wares spill out onto the sidewalk from store fronts, but the paths are still passable. There is no tolerance for even hints of chaos in Japan. In a place as densely populated as East Asia, a bit of rude selfish behavior is necessary to get by, but not in Japan. Japan is an entire society that will exhaust itself in the attempt to not inconvenience others. All life is performance, we act out social interactions as expected, but in Japan this performance has become ritualized, with politeness the dogma backing it. And that’s another big difference I noticed when arriving in Korea, for the first time in a month there was this sense that I was watching people behave naturally as their authentic selves, it was like a breath of fresh air.</p>
        <p>Japan often gets grouped in with the west of East Asia as a culture, and it makes sense in a lot of ways, but having been there and elsewhere in Asia, I’m not sure this is fair. Japan is just Japan, nothing else is like it. And it’s the ritualized politeness that is at the heart of this uniqueness. Kindness towards others, respect towards others, this is all tantamount. Inconveniencing others, not being attentive to the needs of others, this is damnable. You’ll never see a bike lock in Tokyo, there’s no need. You might be crossing 6 lanes of traffic, but a turning car in the far lane will wait any length of time rather than drive over the crosswalk when you are on it (even from 50 feet away). I once did a light jog to get across, feeling bad for the car that was waiting for me. Once on the sidewalk I realized my wallet had fallen out while I scurried across the street, I look up to see the car that was waiting for me had parked a bit down the road (in surely a place no one should be parking) and the young man was running to alert me that I had dropped my wallet. I guess he had weighed the inconvenience he may cause others by stopping his car on a major city road against the guilt that he had somehow contributed to me dropping my wallet. I cannot think of any experience I had that better showcases the incredible kindness the Japanese will show to even a stranger, kindness that will rise to near levels of insanity. </p>
        <p>When I say ritualized politeness I think of how standardized so many interactions in Japan feel. The bowing salaryman in their suits outside an izakaya (Japanese pub) after a long night of drinking with the boss is a stereotypical image, but one that still exists nightly. Businesses will have signs of bowing people as deep apologies if something is not working as intended. Convenience store clerks will belt out mantras of greeting and thanks. I once saw seven individuals directing traffic in and out of a parking garage so as to keep things organized and pedestrians safe (and as little inconvenienced as possible of course). For all the notions of a futuristic society filled with robots, Japan is a heavily employed country where every store, restaurant or museum seems to have twice as many employees as you’d expect. These extra workers are mainly there to make sure everything is running smoothly for the customer. Even restaurants where you order by ticket or tablet will have a couple waiter-like staff just in case you need any help whatsoever. </p>

        <p>If you were to break one of Japan’s cultural norms, such as talking too loudly on the train or entering an onsen (traditional bath house) with tattoos to name a couple, I don’t think anyone would say a word to you. Maybe they figure the shame you must be feeling would be punishment enough. But my gut feeling is the bigger reason would be they’d be flummoxed by the notion of breaking a cultural norm. Obeying the rules of polite society is so hardwired into their cultural dna that any exceptions seem almost outside the realms of possibility. It’s why they say Japan is a great country to visit but a difficult one to live in as a foreigner. Mistakes made by a tourist can be excused, surely a source of infinite comedy and hopefully only a little annoyance for the locals. However, trying to live in such a refined society without both an innate understanding of their cultural norms and an ingrained reflex to follow them would feel impossible. You could never fit in with a culture this unique without being molded by it. The need to be kind towards others is the primary driver here, but it’s not all that positive, the powers of shame and guilt are strong in Japan too. They want to be kind, but not doing so must rack them with guilt. In Singapore, the infamous litany of rules and regulations have tampered the chaos that can be found elsewhere in Asia. There, order is enforced from above. In Japan, order comes from the ground up, it’s just the culture here. I couldn’t help think the Japanese must view the rest of us as barbarians, and I’m not sure they’re wrong.</p>
        <p>I think of Japan as a culture that goes “all-in” on anything it does. This extreme approach to polite society is a prominent example. Feudal cultures often placed prominence on nobility and loyalty, but no culture went as far as the bushido of Japan where missteps could be quickly followed by a suicide to spare any more shame. Nowadays, many have gone all in on anime and video games. Plenty of young men in the US are obsessed with these as well, but in Japan it’s infused the entire culture. Ads for anime and video game characters are abundant, as are cosplayers in the right neighborhoods. Cooking involves obsessive preparation as well, if you’re going to make a dish there’s no reason it shouldn’t have a perfect blend of subtle flavors. This precision in food preparation is part of why Japan’s street food scene is one of the only places it trails in a culinary sense. Quick and good enough isn’t in the cards. The pursuit of perfection is everywhere you look in Japan. This constant strive for everything to be beautiful, clean and orderly, in the gardens yes, but also walking the streets. The pursuit for perfection, what could be more all-in than that.</p>
        <p>This ability to fully commit to something as a society may be what has given Japan the ability to rapidly transform seemingly at will. Many countries have had isolationist periods, but nowhere was this so fully accomplished as Japan during the Tokugawa shogunate. Two centuries completely cut-off from the outside world beyond a single artificial island in Nagasaki harbor built for Dutch traders. Once American naval ships forced Japan to reopen its borders (or harbors as it were, it’s an island chain after all), there were some brief disagreements on how to proceed. But, it didn’t take long for the consensus to realize Japan was woefully behind the rest of the world; nothing worse for technological innovation than xenophobia. Two centuries of stagnation had left Japan in the medieval period while the west was in the industrial revolution. So, Japan had to modernize its economy and military, and it did so, fast. Within 50 years Japan rose from a country centuries behind the west to a global power on par with any nation. Japan rivaled the US during WWII less than 100 years after a few US gunships forced the entire country to shift its tack. </p>

        <p>Then, after defeat in WWII the country pivoted again, and transformed. Rebuilt its economy to export to the west and a full-fledged adoption of democracy. Cars are popular in the US, great, the Japanese figured out how to build them better as quickly as possible. Electronics are the future, great, Japan can be the best at manufacturing those as well. A country with no history of democracy can often struggle to adopt it, there’s a reason so much democratic backsliding can occur in many parts of the world. But Japan is once again an exception, they become a democracy overnight. Unlike most of its culture, Japan’s democracy isn’t perfect, but it has consistently remained a democracy since the rapid transformation to become one. It can commit to isolation, to industrialization, even to democracy. This commitment enables transformation.</p>
        <p>The rapid transformations of Japan stand juxtaposed with a culture that preserves its traditions with complete and utter care. Sumo wrestlers use the same techniques that those centuries ago used, although the actual wrestlers are as likely to be Mongolian as Japanese now. The tea ceremony closely resembles its origins over 1000 years ago. The aesthetic of Japanese buildings and art still preserves a sense of ancient and feudal Japan in a way that other cultures lack. Japan is a country that can look backwards and forwards, modernizing and transforming as needed, without losing sight of its traditions. In some ways it is the model culture, one that is flexible and can evolve as needed, but maintains its heritage and the elements of culture (food, music, art, sport) that make it unique. </p>

        <p>The model culture that merges tradition and transformation, people who put the needs of others over themselves, a place where beauty and efficiency hold sway over everything. It can sound idealized. Japan seems like a miracle to us because it requires a level of buy-in from individuals that isn’t possible anywhere else. </p>
        <p>There is a lot to envy in Japan, but there is something uncomfortable about this perfection. The unnaturalness that comes from suppressing any hint of inner feelings in order to live social performance as ritual. Everything is convenient, and clean, and efficient, but you never really feel like you’re seeing people behave as themselves. We all have times where we must refrain from truly expressing ourselves given the social environment. It’s just in Japan, this seems to be all the time. A Portuguese priest who visited Japan in the 16th century said the Japanese people “have three hearts: a false one in their mouths for all the world to see, another within their breasts only for their friends, and the third in the depths of their hearts, reserved for themselves alone and never manifested to anybody.” Nearly 500 years later this still seems fitting.</p>
