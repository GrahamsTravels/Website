        <p>	In Fort Canning park, one of the beautifully laid out green spaces that fill Singapore, you will see signs with stern orders to not feed the pigeons, an order weighted by an SGD10,000 fine (about $7,800 USD). This falls in line with many expectations we have of Singapore, a country of draconian rules, with laws foreboding spitting or chewing gum, and caning punishments for what we might see as minor misdeeds. These punishments may appear overly harsh, and they are, but they are also emblematic of how Singapore approaches governance. A ruthless, all business form of technocracy. Clearly feeding the birds was becoming an issue, attracting masses of annoying pigeons to an otherwise scenic park. The government had an immediate solution: levy a massive fine on those who feed the birds. No more feeding the birds, problem solved. </p>

        <p>On the trains of Singapore’s world-class metro system, there will be signs forbidding eating and drinking, smoking or flammable goods, all reasonable. One more rule is added to these signs, “No Durians”, durians being the foul-smelling but very popular Southeast Asian fruit. The smell of durians were bothering some train passengers, so you make a rule against them, problem solved. Quick, efficient, technocratic. Singapore is the technocrat’s delight, a one-party state that doesn’t hem and haw when problems present themselves, they quickly identify a solution and put it into practice. No half measures; find the issue, make a rule stopping it. </p>
        <p>Along with being the technocrat’s delight, the city state is the urban planner's paradise. Buildings are mixed use, with food court-like hawker centers and markets on the ground floor, and housing units stretching to the skies above. The city is structured around accessible public transit, ensuring residential areas and commercial spaces create cohesive communities near metro stations (which are abundant). Green spaces abound, there’s the large-scale ones: the globally-famous Gardens by the Bay with its towering sky trees and greenhouses, the botanical gardens with the exquisite orchid collection, and the Central Catchment Reserve (complete with a full rain forest). But, there’s also little slices of green fields within residential districts so that no one feels fully enclosed by looming concrete behemoths.</p>

        <p>Everything one associates with good city planning seems to be evident in Singapore. The Singapore City Gallery is a small museum in Chinatown which essentially serves as a victory lap for their urban planning efforts, heralding the sustainable systems that manage the nation’s water, waste, energy and mobility. And it’s a forward-thinking plan, Singapore is thinking about what the city will need decades into the future. “How will we ensure we have water 50 years from now?” A far step removed from the US where thinking rarely shows more foresight beyond biennial elections or quarterly profit reports.</p>
        <p>The technocracy, urban planning and future-proofing of Singapore’s governance is only possible in light of how its single-party state can independently and securely make decisions without fear of removal. The People’s Action Party has routinely held 90% of parliamentary seats from the time of its founder Lee Kuan Yew, a man viewed as the nation’s founding father, and also its long-ruling dictator. Freedom of speech is limited, and individual liberty hemmed in by the aforementioned draconian rules (and the pervasive CCTV cameras which enforce them). It’s a dictatorship, but a “woke” one. A dictatorship that supports affordable housing, sustainability and ethnic diversity. If there’s a place that will make you question the supremacy of democracy as a political system, Singapore is this place. An enlightened monarchy has undeniable benefits, as long as that monarchy does maintain its enlightenment. </p>
        <p>There are some harsh rules that may seem out of place to western ideals. Smuggling firearms or drugs into Singapore can carry the death penalty. Brutal, but still emblematic of that efficient technocracy which is at the heart of Singapore’s political model. One need not look hard to see how guns and drugs disease the US. Best to keep such things out, so it's capital punishment for smuggling. </p>
        <p>So what are the goals of this woke dictatorship? A strong welfare state? Environmental sustainability? High living standards? Certainly. As well as becoming an economic powerhouse, prosperity being the rising tide which lifts all boats. To do that it’s created a pro-business regulatory state, as light on business rules as it is heavy on cleanliness rules. And those rules about cleanliness serve a purpose too. In order to be a modern, first-world city, Singapore first wants to look the part, clearing the city of the chaotic street life that is so typical of Southeast Asia. Many of the often joked about rules concerning spitting, or gum, or durians are employed with this goal in mind. Singapore can be the first-world bastion within Southeast Asia, providing an opportunity for western businessmen and tourists to visit the region on easy mode, bringing their money with them.</p>
        <p>Nowhere is this attempt to clear the streets of their traditional Asian trappings more evident than the hawker centers. Singapore decided long ago to remove the street food culture from the streets themselves, instead of food carts there are food stalls in these hawker centers, food court-like eateries often found in the first few floors of residential building developments. Some will even have markets right next to them where residents can purchase fresh fruit, or freshly butchered meat and fish. Markets and street food can appear on every corner in much of this region, but in Singapore they are tucked away into these orderly little centers. Once again order is the north star towards which all actions point.</p>
        <p>These hawker centers are not just representative of Singapore’s push for order, but also its desire to maintain its traditional cultures, even while modernization and westernization drive much of the political decision making. And that’s why hawkers centers are among the highlights for any tourist visiting the city. Go see the futuristic Skytree grove and towering cloud forest in the Gardens by the Bay, yes, but don’t skip the hawkers centers of Chinatown where seniors hang around, sipping coffee with their friends, and dining on the cuisines of Singapore’s cultural melting pot. </p>

        <p>Wonton noodles with savory pork. Hokkien chicken rice with meat crispy, tender and moist. Curry puffs with anchovies giving them a perfect little extra bit of flavor. Heaping portions of biryani served on banana leaves. Roti prata with delicious dipping sauces. Nasi Lemak, coconut rice served with sambal and other foods (like an amply sized piece of fried chicken). My personal favorite is Katong laksa, noodle soup in a spicy coconut milk broth. There’s often some cockles mixed in, a smoky and rewarding nugget of flavor when they end up on your spoon. The dish is a mix of Chinese and Malay influences, fusion cuisine centuries in the making. There’s Michelin-guided stalls here and there, but there is no better indicator of quality than a long line wrapping around the tables. The reward must be worth the wait.</p>
        <p>Hawker centers are like little gems of Singapore's traditional cultures that are kept thriving. Cultural transformation is important here, but maintaining the best parts of the tradition is also seen as vital. Religious sites will be tucked in among the more modern buildings that represent the whole range of religions in this cultural melting pot: Buddhist and Daoist, Hindu and Muslim. The most surprising and wonderful of these sights for me is the colorful rooftops of Hindu temples, adorned by all the gods, goddesses and demons in the religion's broad pantheon.</p>

        <p>The country has four official languages, English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil, and almost all signs will display the four. Singapore strives to maintain the legacy of its three major ethnic groups: Chinese (the majority population), Malay and Indian. Singaporean students learn two languages in school, English and their “mother tongue” language. It can be a bit clunky (all Indian-Singaporeans will learn Tamil, regardless of where their Indian heritage is from), but the goal of cultural preservation is clear. The technocratic state identified the loss of cultural heritage as a potential downside of modernization, and works to prevent such an issue from arising.</p>
        <p>There are three ethnically-focused neighborhoods: Chinatown, Kampong Glam (the Muslim Quarter) and Little India. Chinatown is the largest, and seems the most natural. It’s lived in, with residential blocks and a healthy distribution of restaurants and bars that target locals. The neighborhood blends in with the surrounding city and the transition from Chinatown to the downtown business district that borders it seems gradual and fluid. On the other hand, the Muslim Quarter is a small area of traditional buildings a few stories in height. Surrounding it are behemoth skyscrapers, casting shadows. The Sultan Mosque is surrounded by Lebanese and Turkish restaurants. Hajj lane is now a prime spot for bar hopping. This neighborhood seems little more than a relic for tourism.</p>

        <p>The most interesting of the three is Little India. In addition to the temples and Indian restaurants, you’ll find stores selling cheap goods, pawn shops displaying a range of gold and places to send money orders. On Sundays, you’ll see the streets of Little India crowded with young South Asian men, maybe the most Indian of Singapore’s residents, the migrant workers who have come here for jobs. The neighborhood services this population, allowing them to do their shopping, send money (and gold) back home, and socialize on their days off. The crowds can become massive, unruly by the standards of this orderly city-state. I saw dozen police officers struggling to keep the crosswalks clear during green lights, a shocking sight here where you can rarely spot a cop (CCTV is all the enforcement they need). Seeing all this, I feel like I am peering under the surface of Singapore’s perfectly organized system. It’s almost like Singapore has conceded to allow this bit of disorder, perhaps they need to keep these migrant workers happy, allowing them a chance to enjoy themselves. They need builders and landscapers, and the rich nation might be finding it harder and harder to find locals willing to perform these less desirable jobs. For all its technocracy and urban planning, Singapore still struggles with one of the challenges that every developed nation has: who does the hard work after the population gets rich.</p>
