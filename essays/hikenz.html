        <p>New Zealand has a whole cottage industry designed around moving people between trailheads. There are some loop or out and back trails, but many of New Zealand’s greatest hikes go from one trailhead to another which can be very far apart. Sometimes a half hour drive, other times up to four hours in a nation filled with indirect roads that wind around mountain passes and lakes. There are shuttles of course, but then there are also services that move your car from one end of the hike to the other. If you eat dinner in the little town on the outskirts of Tongariro National Park you’ll see your view slightly obscured by several parked car carriers each hauling eight or more cars waiting to drop cars off at the pre-arranged time. To hike the Routeburn track, I paid a service a few hundred dollars to move my car four hours. A heavy price to pay, but one that saved me several days and around sixteen miles of hiking. You’ll even find water taxis necessary for drop-offs and pick-ups on some hikes. This is a water-heavy country, an island nation with abundant rivers and lakes. For all these various transport methods, you’re still likely to find a fair number of hitchhikers near any popular trailhead. </p>
        <p>New Zealand is the land of great hiking, or trekking, or tramping, whatever you want to call it. It has spectacular scenery and going for a long walk provides the opportunity to breathe it in. It’s literally a fantasy world, famous as the shooting location for the Lord of the Rings. You can imagine yourself as a questing hobbit walking across the mountains, over the rivers and through the forests. The kiwi government knows the draw that hiking has for the nation, and tourism is an essential industry here. They’ve designated eleven “great walks,” famed multi-day hikes to help amplify this draw. Four of the eleven are centered around Fiordland, the largest of New Zealand’s national parks, but the country continues to add more that are spread across a greater range of parks and other less toured locations. A great walk can be a tourist attraction that pulls in visitors (and money) to a local economy as would any historic site or amusement park. The walks are popular and can be crowded, but for good reason as they offer great bang for your buck. It’s not easy to get on top of mountain ridges for extended periods in New Zealand, these are deep valleys with high, steep walls. But some of the walks get you up high for long stretches. </p>
        <p>I hiked three of the great walks, and visited seven of the nation’s thirteen national parks, not bad for six weeks. I first hiked the Abel Tasman coastal track, found in the eponymous national park, both named after a Dutch explorer who first arrived in New Zealand on the northwest of the South Island, fairly close to where the park is located. It must have been like arriving in Eden; the park lacks the great mountains of other areas, but NZ’s coasts can be just as spectacular. Over forty miles of coastline spotted with perfectly sliced crescent beaches sheltered by gentle hills covered with palm-rich forests. The green of the forest gives way to the thin line of sand that divides it from the gentle turquoise of the water. Water in NZ always seems to be the perfect shade of blue whether it’s on the coast or in a glacial river. </p>
        <p>The views are more seldom, little gaps in the trees from the trail overlooking the magnificent beaches. This is a hike that is less about the journey and more about the destination, or destinations as every half hour of walking will bring you to a new beach. It’s a hike best done in a swimsuit so that you can jump in whenever, enjoying the brisk but gentle surf. The farther you swim out the better the view back towards the forested hills. </p>

        <p>One fun part of the journey is the tidal flats, parts of the hike that can only be walked across near low tide. Missing low tide at a few means an extended detour, at one though it is entirely impossible to traverse.The lesser tidal crossing are unique experiences, walking through mud that will be covered by several feet of water in a few hours, boats stranded around you. These are easy enough, but the true titan is Awaroa, this is the one that offers no detour. You must cross near to low tide, and very near indeed. I crossed around low tide but still found myself in knee deep water with a current that didn’t feel too calm with a 30lb pack. Maybe there’s a way to stay in ankle deep water, but that would involve more zig-zagging than even the most water-cautious hiker could endure. I can’t imagine the challenges of crossing these few hundred yards even two hours away from low tide, something that park rangers pretty adamantly forbid. Timing the tides brings a creative challenge to a hike that largely involves fairly tame up and downs. </p>

            <figcaption><em>Boats stranded at low tide</em></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This is the most accessible and thus most crowded of the great walks. The abundant campgrounds make it easy to get a booking (a challenging feat for other great walks that only offer a few huts). The (relatively) gentle walking by great walk standards means it can be a family vacation. And non-hikers can get on the trail easily from the water, via tour boat, water taxi or personal vessel . You’ll even find kayakers accessing the same campsites, essentially doing the trail from the water. It’s great that so many can enjoy these beaches, but it’s a little odd to find a 40 mile trail as crowded as a sidewalk at times. Navigating around 30 person tour groups isn’t the most pleasant experience when attempting to embed oneself in nature. There are a handful of campsites that can host 50+ hikers, evenly stretched about eight miles apart. These are designed for an itinerary going mega-campsite to mega-campsite over a five day hike. I stay at one of these; it’s beautiful, a campsite on a beach which tides transform throughout the day leaving it a narrow peninsula at high tide. But it’s also crowded, resembling a family campground rather than some backcountry site. New Zealand is a country crowded with tourists, especially on the south island. The desire and fitness that allows someone to complete difficult hikes, both in length and elevation, grants an ability to avoid the crowds, but this is not so in Abel Tasman. On the water taxi ride back to the trailhead I can’t help but think this park is best viewed from the water, maybe the great walk is better as a great paddle, completed via kayak. There are some campsites that are only accessible by water, surely those provide a more remote experience. </p>
        <p>Later in my road trip around the south island, I arrived at the foremost of NZ’s parks, Fiordland. The namesake fjords are seven great inlets that lead into the sea, but with the exception of Milford Sound these are very difficult to access. For all the hiking the park offers, looking at a map will show you barely edging into the massive expanse of the park. It’s hard to know what is out there in the deep forest mountains and valleys. The takahe, a native species of flightless birds, was thought extinct for half a century before it was found again in the depths of Fiordland.</p>
        <p>Here I plan to do two great walks, the Kepler track and the Routeburn track. Bookings are more difficult than in Abel Tasman, although this promises more sparsely populated trails. We’re in mountain country; alpine climates are less predictable, and alpine terrain more fragile, so the conservation service mainly allows hikers to stay at huts. But these huts book out months in advance, impossible to thread that needle in timing during a 6-month long trip. The campsites are less common, but easier to book, achievable with only a week’s notice. </p>
        <p>Kepler has a “typical” itinerary of four days, three nights, with a night at each of the trail’s three huts about nine miles apart. There’s a way to do it via the two campsites, but it involves longer days. The first day (eight miles) and the last (fourteen but flat) are lengthy but achievable. It’s easy walking, but all flat through a forest. A gorgeous forest of mosses and ferns for sure, but one that gets repetitive across over twenty miles. It’s the middle day with all the elevation that is the most difficult but also the reason for doing the hike.</p>
        <p>After a few miles of ascent up the ridge on that second day, I cleared the tree line for views back towards lake Te Anau and the small town that shares its name on the far shore. It’s an epic view, but I’m still looking back towards “civilization” not towards Fiordland itself. As I turned the corner around Mount Luxmore, the view of the full park unveiled itself before me. Rolling mountains as far as the eye can see, it’s the kind of view that changes your life, the type of scenery that you couldn’t imagine existed before. A little backtrack up to Luxmore’s peak provides a 360 view with glaciers sparkling on far off mountains. As I sat on top of Luxmore I grew excited knowing I was about to walk into that view. I followed a seemingly never ending ridgeline with evolving views. It's the best stretch of hiking I’ve ever done, and I’ve walked enough to have some credibility. Beautiful ridges made of rock and tussock grass fade into forested valleys below. Far below the trail is the south fjord of lake Te Anau, its great mass bespeckled by white caps. A sail boat only appears as a lone dot when seen from far above. </p>

        <p>I walk slowly, no need to rush it, I may never be on a trail this beautiful again. Soak in the views that flow in every direction. I stopped to take many a photo. There is a risk with those stops, the kea flies these hills. The kea is the world’s only alpine parrot, a fact that accompanies its name on every plaque or pamphlet available in the park. But the more common descriptor is “cheeky.” Wickedly smart the birds seem to know to wait until I am taking a panorama to make a strike at my bag. Rubber aficionados, they’ve also been known to peck at the tires of cars stopped at red lights. Kea are a joy to watch as they playfully fly with their cheerful screech echoing the hills, just be wary to not leave your pack unattended.</p>

            <figcaption><em>Views from the ridge lines on the Kepler track</em></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>As I begin to make my descent below the treeline my heart grows sour. Leaving views this good brings more melancholy than any excitement for a chance to finally rest my feet. The campsite is in a clearing with epic cliff walls on every side. It’s a nice capstone for the day, but it’s hard not to feel a little sad after seeing all that beauty and then leaving it.</p>
        <p>As incredible as the second day of Kepler is, Routeburn may have it beat overall. Kepler has long stretches, great above the treeline, but redundant below it. Routeburn is more varied. It starts to gradually ascend up the ridge, flirting with the treeline to offer views until it arrives at Lake Mackenzie. Then, a short stint through giant boulders with gnarly trees growing among them (all covered by moss). Emerging from these mossy woods the treeline falls away behind you as you ascend out of the Lake Mackenzie valley and then onto the ridgeline. There’s far stretching views of Fiordland, and then a walk along the side of one ridge. This stretch has views near with little mountain ponds (tarns), boulders and cliffs around you, and far both on the opposite ridge and below in the valley. The trail takes a right turn cutting into the ridge through Harris saddle. You say goodbye to Fiordland here before entering Mt Aspiring national park as you move through the mountain pass. The mountain peaks and cliffs surround while walking by little Lake Harris nestled in the pass, and then following the waters as they descend through marsh, then waterfall into the river below. The hike enters the river valley at the far end where I camp, here the Route burn begins, the river that offers the hike its name. The second day of the hike emerges out through a chasm-like canyon with cliffs all around. The river is strong here, you can see its impact in the sheerness of the terrain.</p>

            <figcaption><em>Walking through Harris saddle</em></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>All in all the hike is only 20.5 miles long, making it the shortest of the great walks. It's day-hikable for the adventurous, and the three huts and two campsites give plenty of options for splitting it over two days. Although, booking only a week in advance leaves me splitting the hike 80/20, 16 miles day one, 4 miles day two. Only 20 miles hiked, but 200 miles driven. It’s over four hours from trailhead to trailhead. Cutting through the mountains in that little slice which is Harris saddle, from one national park to another, from one state to another, truly feels as much like an epic journey as any hike can.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>The only other great walk I dabble on is the Tongariro Northern Circuit. I go for the Tongariro Alpine Crossing, a day hike version that spends around half its time on a shared trail with the longer trek. Tongariro is a national park known for three great volcanoes standing alone on the north island. Tongariro itself is actually the lesser of the volcanoes; Mt Ngauruhoe is a perfectly shaped cone best known as the stand-in for Mt Doom in Lord of the Rings and Mt Ruapehu is a mountain massive in its breadth, taking hours to drive around and home to three distinct ski resorts. </p>
        <p>The terrain of the hike is otherworldly. Early on there are great views of Ngauruhoe, you can see where different lava flows crawled down the mountain slope, cooling and remaining in place. Then you find yourself right up next to the mountain and its red rim beautifully contrasts with the black rock. Nestled between Ngaruhoe and Tongariro the trail takes you through a dust bowl that feels like an alien desert. Or it seems like an alien desert until you look over a ridge to see an area filled with curved black rocks. This is the filming location for Morder, and it is truly alien in a way that Star Trek sets could only dream. Walking by a lesser crater gives you a view over mountain pools, as always the perfect shade of light blue in this country. There are wisps of smoke rising from the rocks, and a stink of sulfur on the wind. After clearing the volcanoes the trail descends with a view of Lake Taupo in the distance. Taupo is the largest lake in New Zealand, and it’s the aftereffect of a volcano itself. It’s a former caldera, a great subterranean bubble of magma erupted here 25,000 years ago, leaving the depression that the waters of Taupo now inhabit.</p>

            <figcaption><em>Mt Ngauruhoe from behind </em></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Tongariro offers a uniquely beautiful landscape, and everyone seems to know it. The Alpine Crossing is exceptionally crowded considering it’s a 13-mile trek with serious elevation. At times there is traffic on the uphills. And a treacherous bit of downhill sliding through gravel for fifteen minutes becomes even more dangerous as you descend surrounded by other hikers of various skill levels. A dust cloud rises around you as your muscles strain to avoid crashing into others. Here again, the crowds don’t ruin the experience, but they certainly can mar it. If there was a great walk I’d like to do on a return trip it’d be the Northern Circuit. The longer route offers better views of Ruapehu, a walk through the alieness of Mordor, and a way to avoid the crowds on most of its length. </p>
        <p>There are good day hikes in New Zealand too. There’s Lake Marian in Fiordland, a scrambling climb up to a cavernous glacier valley with the lake resting inside it. Rob Roy Glacier next to Mt Aspiring rises like an altar up above you with at least twenty waterfalls dropping out of it. Avalanche Peak is a hellacious climb, 3,500 feet in only two miles, but gives a panoramic view of Arthur’s Pass national park (one of only three roads through the mountains that bisect the south island). </p>
        <p>My favorite was Mueller’s hut trail, a climb that is usually a day hike, but can also involve an overnight stay at the hut. It’s the highest you can get in Mt Cook national park without mountaineering skills. Mt Ollivier rises above the hut and gives a view of all the national park has to offer. The flat as paper floodplain approaching the mountain passes. Glaciers above cliffs, and below in valleys. Ridges with white snow and black rock up high, and green and grey lower down. A mosaic of colors on display. Keas serenade the hikers as they take it all in. The centerpiece of course is Mt Cook itself, the nation’s highest peak. A long ridgeline sharply curves upward into the mountain that stands alone even surrounded by peaks over a mile high. It’s impossible to take your eyes off it. I spend an hour sitting up top basking in its glory, and I’m not the only one. A break from the steep hiking is also nice. Mt Cook is tremendous even on the drive into the park, rising up from the flat planes below it’s undeniable.</p>

        </figure>                
        <p>And here too everyone recognizes the beauty, so they flock here. Mueller’s hut trail allows you to escape the crowds. The alternative is the Hooker Valley trail, a flat walk that becomes inundated with shoulder to shoulder crowds once the buses arrive at 830am. Campsites also become crowded in New Zealand. Many can seem more like parking lots with endless campervans and RVs; it can be hard to find a spot to pitch a tent. The idealized NZ vacation traveling by van has infected the collective mind of tourists. The country is overrun by these vans and it seems like the golden age of freedom camping is over as vans are now restricted to designated parking spots or campsites.</p>

        <p>NZ camping may not offer too many quiet relaxing spots, but there is some joy here from the locals. No one loves to talk more at a campsite than kiwis. They may just walk up and approach you and jump into conversation with a friendliness that is unmatched. They can power through any awkward pause and keep the chat going. Incredibly humble too, I often got asked “how do you know about us?” like they are still confused why the whole world’s tourists decided to descend on their little island nation. </p>
        <p>There can be good people watching at these campsites too. I once saw a man rewatching drone footage, another checking his hang gliding parachute and a couple organizing caving gear camping in a row. New Zealand seems to be the “world capital” of any outdoors activity. Mountain biking, absolutely! ATVs, sure! Even less adventurous hobbies like fly fishing can lay claim to NZ as their capital. The terrain here seems perfect for any adventure, and there is no setting more scenic for said adventure. Picturesque is probably the perfect word to describe New Zealand. Mt Cook and its surroundings are what mountains look like on cheap fantasy novel covers. Abel Tasman’s beaches look like they are out of an AI-created tourism brochure. If you asked a six-year old to draw a volcano, they would draw Mt Ngauruhoe. The whole nation lies on a fault line. It brings the perils of volcanoes and earthquakes, but blesses the country with scenery second to none.</p>
        <p>The landscapes of New Zealand are its national treasure, and an essential driver of economic output. The nation’s beauty is its most important natural resource, the competitive advantage of the country to use economic lingo. Tourism of course brings a double-edged sword. Locals are endlessly frustrated with the slow-driving RVs helmed by tourists who have never driven anything bigger than a sedan before. The only locals who I met who lacked that undeniable kiwi charm were those in hospitality roles, perhaps burnt out by the endless stream of tourists. The beauty brings the tourists, but the tourists can mar the beauty by crowding the natural spaces. And yet, New Zealand has no choice but to embrace tourism. Beyond the tourists, the main exports are wood and wool. In Lyttelton harbor (on the inside of an ancient volcano, again the country is spectacular everywhere you look), I saw logs being loaded onto cargo ships, replacing thousands of containers. Whatever is in the containers surely costs more than the wood that is replacing it. Tourism is the economic windfall that can make up the difference.</p>
