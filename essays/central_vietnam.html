        <p>It can rain a lot in Vietnam. It’s why everything is so green, the growth of life is unstoppable here. In cities, you’ll see trees built into alleys and walls, incorporating the plant life rather than removing it. They love plants here, the average apartment block will have hundreds of plants growing off of backside balconies, like the hanging gardens of Babylon on a narrow Vietnamese street. The United States military tried to fight against the greenery, destroying it in an attempt to prevent the Viet Cong using it for cover while transporting weapons and supplies along the Ho Chi Minh trail. They failed. Rains, and the plants they give life to, are a way of life here.</p>
        <p>A friend and I took a sleeper train from Hanoi into rural central Vietnam. A typhoon had been approaching the region but had fallen apart off the coast, the winds never made landfall, but there was a lot of water that needed to go somewhere. When we awoke, flood plains stretched off in every direction and the rain was constant. Lakes that appeared to surround the train tracks were not present when looking at Google maps. When the train arrived at the next stop it could not go any farther that day because of flooding farther down the route, the plan was to have buses transport the passengers around the flooded tracks to resume the train journey at another station. Luckily it was our stop, but it took some time to negotiate our way off: they didn’t want tourists wandering off in a small rural city. And despite that, the train was probably the best way to go. Another traveler we met at our hostel that night had come in via night bus, and was in the process of drying out all his clothes because the bus had to go through large puddles several feet deep (if they can even be called puddles at that point). The luggage compartments at the bottom of the bus were drenched through, woe to those with electronics down there.</p>
        <p>	Despite all the evidence that this was a bad flood, none of the locals seemed to be too concerned about it. In some ways, the land’s layout is made to handle these kinds of floods.The river rose to near its banks, but not over them onto the road and into homes. Rice paddies which are meant to flood dominate the countryside, with roadways the only thing rising above them. Deep water rice likes all this water. Vietnamese homes have tile floors with no rugs, and nothing is stored on the ground. They are well prepared for water. Nothing in the attitudes of the locals speaks to this flood as an unusual one. There certainly are some floods that rise to major issues, but this flood seemed more as something to be expected and prepared for, but not worth getting too excited about, just a way of life. Maybe dealing with regular flood waters is one source of Vietnamese resiliency and adaptability.</p>

        <p>You might ask why we had come into a flood in rural Vietnam. We had come for caves, Phong Nha national park and the surrounding area is home to some of the world’s largest caves, including Hang Son Doong, the absolute largest. Unsurprisingly, caving isn’t something that works well with floods, so the first day we arrive we aimlessly drift around the small town as none of the caves are safe to enter. It’s a small farming village that has seen a few hotels and restaurants added in recent years to service the newfound tourist interest in the caves. That night we are told there is only one cave that will be open the next day, if we want to get into one of these huge caves this is our chance.</p>
        <p>	As it’s the only game in town that day, the tour is a popular one, about 25 people in all. It takes a while to get everyone organized, you get the sense the guides aren’t used to a tour this big. They’ve got an opportunity as the only cave open and they aren’t going to turn anyone away. We finally get on our way, driving up through mountain farms before finally stopping at a little road. We change into swimsuits and rubber sandals, leaving the phones in the bus. The walk into the field is almost as beautiful as what is to come. Through fields with water buffalo and into forest mountains half hidden in mist. It seems out of a fantasy world and practically is, the guides tell us this was a filming location for Kong Skull Island.</p>
        <p>	We wind through rivers and streams. The fast flowing ones with clear water aren’t a risk, it’s the muddy ones that are infested with leeches. Stopping for a moment makes you an easier target, you have to keep moving. Everyone ends up with a dozen across the day regardless. Snuggling into hard to find spots, behind the knee and between toes, they are tricky to remove, grabbing hard with their many-toothed jaws. Even when you get one loose, it’s quick to grab onto your hand before you can flick them away. But it’s all part of the fun, the blood flows a lot for a few seconds, but dries up almost immediately. Type 2 fun for sure, but not much more than a gross annoyance.</p>

        </figure>     
        <p>	Once we get to the cave we see its massive mouth, a strong current flowing out. But that is not where we will enter, we begin a tough 15 minute climb up the mountain, stepping on sharp stones with the rubber sandals barely providing a shield. This is why the cave is open, it’s in a mountain so the flood waters drain out. Eventually we reach an entrance up high, a massive pit in the earth, and start to descend turning our headlamps on. As we enter the depths of the cave, a look back up gives an incredible view with a small circle of light enclosed by the darkness of the cave. </p>
        <p>	Inside we see sheer drops of 100s of feet. We were told this is maybe one of the ten largest caves in the area, a fact that seems impossible in view of this cave's size. You can understand how this area has become such a hotspot for cavers. At one point everyone turns off their lights to appreciate the true darkness. We twist through nooks and crannies, eventually coming to a ladder several hundred feet long to descend down to the base of the cave. It’s a beautiful sight to see the lights descending in the darkness, yet one that is hard to appreciate when on the ladder yourself. A little nerve wracking to be sure, everyone is given some carabiners to lock into the ladder. Safety is definitely top of mind for the guides, an accident could doom not only their company, but the local economy if it dries up the tourism. </p>
        <p>At the bottom we jump into the water to float out the mouth of the cave, an incredible experience for all. At our hostel, those of us who went on the trip recount to others the excitement and recommend they go on the tour tomorrow. Surely something similar is happening at other hostels and hotels around town. Being the one tour that can run despite the flooding could have a knock on effect for the company, as recommendations roll over day after day. This is still a fledgling tourist industry, Phong Nha only opened as a national park in 2001, and the destination’s popularity only really took hold a decade later as tour companies were allowed to “rent” different caves. The town is still small and undeveloped, not necessarily true for other Vietnamese tourist spots.</p>

        <p>Ha Long bay (and neighboring Ha Lan bay) are among the crown jewels of Vietnamese tourism. Rocky hills emerging right out of the sea (covered in greenery of course), a uniquely beautiful scene. This is another filming location for Hollywood. Ha Long translates to descending dragon as the little mountains look like the back of a dragon swimming in the surf. Naturally, tourists flock here for cruises. There are tours that pick you right up 3 hours away in Hanoi for day or overnight tours, but the hours spent on the boat can be limited with these options. Cat Ba island is the nearest access point, with its own fleet of tour boats that can give a little more time on the water. </p>

        <p>I’ve been to Vietnam twice, about a decade apart. Surprisingly little has changed in the two major cities, to my eyes, the main changes are pretty surface level: more traffic lights and craft beers, less stray dogs. Where the changes are more apparent are the far flung corners that make up Vietnam’s tourism hot spots. Both times I’ve gone to Cat Ba and Ha Long bay, the second time I could see the arrival of a few luxury hotels, mainly targeted at wealthy Chinese tourists. And more changes are on the horizon. The harbor of Cat Ba town is currently home to a massive construction project as they build a beach out into the water. Signs on the fencing surrounding the construction promise a new luxury tourist development. It surely looks fantastic, but the current town is notably absent. Out with the old and in with the new; there’s more money in luxury hotels than the pseudo-ecotourism targeted at backpackers that the town primarily services today.</p>

        <p>The bay itself is a UNESCO landmark and a national park, hopefully shielded from any major developments. As it should be, there are few places as beautiful that someone can kayak and swim in the world. Although, even when touring the bay, it can be hard to ignore the harsh march of progress. Tours will stop at the floating fish farms, poor structures held afloat by styrofoam blocks which disintegrate into the water, and a major source of the trash awash in the bay. This is the last of the bay's native culture, living a meager life on the edge of a bay they once roamed. The tour guide tells us the government will soon remove all these fish farms, leaving perhaps one near the harbor as a relic maintained for tourists. He also gives us the sales pitch on why it’s a good thing: environmentalism, reduced poverty, better education for the children. All probably true, but the real reason is because these fish farms are too much of an eyesore to allow in such a critical tourist destination. It’s not hard to imagine the lives of these people will be better when they are relocated to land, but it’s still eerie to be present in the last days of an old and fading culture. </p>

        <br>        
        <p>Another of Vietnam’s tourism crown jewels is Hoi An, a small coastal city around the midpoint of the country. It was a major trading center over the centuries with merchants flocking from China and Japan. The old town is filled with beautiful old buildings along the river which becomes quite the sight at night with floating lanterns lighting it up. The cuisine is hyper local, a credit to the cultural fusion of the locals and the merchants, and there’s a long beach a few miles away. So there’s a lot to love here, and the tourists know.</p>
        <p>If there’s a town in Vietnam that is overrun with tourists, this would be the one. So many tour groups that the old town can become gridlocked. Most of the shops sell useless plastic crap at ripoff prices. There’s vendors everywhere trying to get you to buy their tchotchke or take a ride on their boat. </p>
        <p>Despite all this, there’s still little slices of the town that retain their charm. Viewed from the right angle, the beauty of the town, and especially the river at night, remains undeniable. A little tea house tucked away that is operated by the deaf and asks for patrons to remain quiet, enjoying and reflecting on the tea in silence. Food shops where the grannies that run them are all too eager to stand next to you as you eat and explain how to eat their dish. Central Vietnam loves to wrap one food (usually lettuce or rice paper) around another food, and even more they love to explain to you exactly how this should be done. </p>

        </figure> 
        <p>If there’s a highlight to Hoi An, it’s probably that food. This is a great place to do a food tour, by yourself or with a guide. There’s mi quang (refreshingly cold noodle salad), banh vap (soft little dumplings), chao ngheu (delicious and greasy clam rice gruel) and banh dap & hen xao (closest explanation would be Vietnamese chips & dip). The favorite was Banh Beo, a little rice cake in its own flat bowl. We come across an elderly couple selling these out of their living room, with a table set up in the alley next to their home. We get the last four available, with the vendor showing us how to cut them into pieces and scoop them out. The best bits are always still there, you just have to look for them.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>  
        <p>There are two popular islands in southern Vietnam, Phu Quoc and Con Dao. Phu Quoc is larger and more developed, complete with an amusement park. I went to Con Dao, an island which still seems to be more frequented by Vietnamese tourists than western ones. Beautiful beaches that are still off the beaten track if not fully undiscovered. The island is small enough to be biked around in an hour or two, or more if you take your time to explore hidden little trails and gorgeous swimming spots. The best of which I only find because a small dirt patch by the side of the road already has a bike on it. I park my own bike, squeeze through a tight little trail between the bushes and out onto a rocky outcropping. Deep blue water with specters of turquoise within it marking the shallows; light blue sky silhouetting hills of lush rainforest so dense it’s memorizing; colorful little fish boats sitting in the water. I swim here alone, a single fisherman on the other side of the rock is my only company. This is paradise.</p>

            <figcaption><em>A secluded swimming spot on Con Dao</em></figcaption>
        </figure> 
        <p>Con Dao is among the most scenic places in Vietnam, and one of the best to see wildlife. Monkeys line the mountain roads and leap through the trees, often only identifiable when branches seem to move with too much abruptness to be caused by wind. A rooftop cocktail bar provides a perfect spot to view the parade of flying foxes, fruit bats with 4 foot wingspans, gliding into town at dusk. They rustle in the trees at night with half eaten fruits plummeting down onto the sidewalks. </p>
        <p>There’s lots of natural wonder in Con Dao, but the reason for its popularity among Vietnamese tourists lies as much in its tragic history. Used as a prison for political prisoners, first by the French and then by the Southern Vietnamese, it was home to some of the worst atrocities across the colonial period and the Vietnam-American war. Horrific torture and despicable conditions were constant in the prison’s tiger cages. The island’s museum has a long wall of the martyrs who lost their lives there (martyrs being the word used by the Vietnamese to describe those who gave their lives in the independence struggle). It’s not the only tourist spot where a history of war remains. On Cat Ba, a massive cave system is home to an old hospital bunker used by inhabitants during US bombing campaigns. Even more subtlety, there are some utensils and gear still sitting in the cave near Phong Nha; you’d think it was placed there by the guides, but they don’t even draw attention to it, only mentioning it as an afterthought when asked.</p>
        <p>Vietnam is developing and shifting in reaction to growing tourism, that double edged sword that tourism brings, growth and with it a change from what made a space so special to begin with. The beauty and the charm will always be there though as long as you look for it, as will be the tragedy that so lingers in this country’s history. </p>
