        <p>It’s easy to fixate on the buzzing traffic when walking the streets of Hanoi. A constant deluge of motor bikes weaving together in a blur of efficient chaos. The cacophony of horns is so constant that it just blends into the background as white noise. Everyone drives with intensity, only focusing on getting themselves from point A to point B as quickly as possible, but somehow it all works perfectly. Rarely do you see a crash and the main evidence of accidents are young western tourists sporting scabbed-over scrapes, never the locals.</p>
                <p>Yet, what is all the more fascinating is what happens beside the streets on the beautiful clutter of Hanoi’s sidewalks. Diners sit on plastic stools while slurping down delicious noodle soups, beside them the food vendors grill pork and wash dishes right on the curb. Shopowners display their wares, laborers take a load off while sipping iced tea, and everyone parks their motorbikes. And these are just the standard sights as you’ll also find a myriad of one-off entrepreneurs, my favorite of which was a man set up with a tire pump, likely having selected a busy intersection where drivers notice their tires are running low. </p>

        <p>It’s clear from the mix of vendors that fill Vietnamese sidewalks, hawking everything from Pho to bamboo ladders to tire air, that this may be the most capitalistic place in the world (despite the official title of this one-party government). Entrepreneurship is rampant here where everyone can find a way to make money. If there is a need for good or service, someone will find a way to provide it, and both the seller and the customer will be better off. And this isn’t just street vendors or shop owners, you’ll see motorbikes transporting everything from ladders to 10 foot pipes to cages of chickens. There is an inherent buzz in the air of an economy operating in full swing. A million little pieces working independently as it all adds up to something beautiful. </p>
        <p>	Hanoi is the capital of Vietnam, and the government district immediately stands out as distinctive from the rest of the city. Here, the wide boulevards with broad sidewalks and colonial buildings housing government departments and foreign embassies can be quickly identified as French built. The National Assembly building, barely over ten years old, is more distinctly Vietnamese, with trees rising out of gaps in the facade. Ho Chi Minh’s mausoleum lies across the square of the Assembly building, complete with “Uncle Ho’s” embalmed corpse, this is the destination for many Vietnamese making pilgrimage to honor the great man. And the old imperial citadel still stands as a museum, although as can often be the case in Vietnamese historical sights, it’s never quite sure what is ancient, and what was rebuilt last year. There is a need to establish the legitimacy of the one-party state, tying it to a 1000 years of Vietnamese dynasties who reigned from that citadel, and the legacy of a founding father whose face appears on every denomination of dong (Vietnam’s currency). But the need to build legitimacy doesn’t prevent the Vietnamese from repurposing the well-built structures of their one-time colonizers. Ceremony is important, but it doesn’t get in the way of practical flexibility.  </p>

        <p>Despite its capital status, Hanoi’s government district is not the star of the show, that would be the city’s old quarter, where the bustling streets of Vietnam are at their busiest. The city emerged around 1000 years ago as temporary markets that formed between the citadel gates and the Red River became a more permanent village. The market origins of the city led to streets and neighborhoods dedicated for individual crafts. This silolization is still on display today as you can walk down one street with shop after shop selling kitchen wares, then turn the corner to a street of butchers. Buildings are narrow to maximize the number of store fronts on each street. The front room facing the street will often be a shop, with the family’s living space following along behind. Entrepreneurship is woven into the very architecture of this city.</p>
        <p>It’s that love of entrepreneurship that makes Hanoi special, but it’s also the way people view public space. In the US, sidewalks are meant for walking, someone taking up too much space will quickly have to contend with a cop giving them a ticket. Public space there is designed for no one to use, whereas public space in Vietnam is for everyone to use. This is a country where the “third place” is alive and well, from bia hois (Vietnamese pubs), to a lively cafe culture day and night, to parks that are as crowded as can be every night with joggers, exercise dancers and youths playing some hacky-sack variant with a badminton shuttlecock. People use every inch of public space for their own purposes, and it creates a truly beautiful tapestry of culture. </p>

        <p>Vietnamese culture is a lot about socializing, you will constantly see people chatting on street corners, or on stools surrounding small drink stands, enjoying a midday break with some cold tea. The mornings are spent at cafes, and evenings often at those bia hois. Like many Vietnamese establishments, these pubs are named after what they sell, unpasteurized beer brewed in the morning to be drunk later that day. Bia hoi directly translates to fresh beer. A glass often goes to 10K to 15K dong (about 40 to 60 cents). The glasses are small and the beer is light and refreshing, perfect for the hot and humid tropical weather. You can spend long hours sipping on this light beer enjoying the night while chatting away. The buildings are open aired, and like everything else here, the business spills out onto the sidewalk and street, with plastic tables and chairs added and subtracted as needed. As these are social meals, food is meant to be shared; a typical order for a table of 3 or 4 might be big plates of fried rice and stir-fried morning glories with garlic, and a protein dish as the main course. The sides are always good, the main dish can vary. Not every restaurant will make the perfect stir fried squid, but that shouldn’t stop you from searching for it. </p>
        <p>If you want to spend a night eating and drinking where the native Hanoians are, these bia hois are the place to be. In the tourist center of old quarter, every bar or restaurant seems the same, with a greeter aggressively trying to pull you into a seat. The english-language menus will have a mix of overpriced western and Vietnamese food, and none of it will be too good. If you’re looking for a good meal in Vietnam, a menu in english sitting on a stand out front is a major red flag. Instead, walk 15 minutes away from the central tourist area, and look for a place that seems popular with the locals. If the sidewalk seats are crowded with Vietnamese youths, that’s a good sign the food will be delicious, and safe to eat (a high volume eatery is probably the best way to avoid an upset stomach, fresh is best).</p>
        <p>Farther afield from the tourist area, and you can find lively places where western faces will elicit a bit more surprise. “What are you doing here?” the patrons' faces might say, but never in an accusatory or discouraging way, always excited and interested. “Where are you from?” is the real question, and whatever the answer they will be happy to hear. Say what you can in Vietnamese and everyone will be happy at the effort. The Vietnamese’s tonal nature makes it difficult for western tongues, and nigh impossible for a novice, but any attempt will get you a pleased response, a metaphorical pat on the head (but not a real one which is seen as offensive in Vietnam). It’s amazing what can be communicated when shared vocabulary only amounts to a few dozen words. Rubbing your stomach after eating and saying, or attempting to say, <em>ngon</em> (delicious) will attract happiness. People are thrilled when tourists like Vietnamese food, they are proud of their culture, their food, their language, and happy to share it with tourists willing to make the effort. </p>
