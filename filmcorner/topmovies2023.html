        <h2> 10. Beau Is Afraid (Ari Aster) </h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
                <img src="https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/12-most-shocking-moments-in-beau-is-afraid-ranked/dont-go-into-the-attic-1682348123.jpg"/>

        <p>What would the world look like if every anxious fear was completely reasonable? ‘Beau Is Afraid' aspires to answer this question as leaving an apartment building door ajar can immediately lead to mortal danger, your friends and family ARE listening in on your therapy sessions, and any other fear that has ever slipped into your brain comes to fruition. The film labors on for 3 full hours, which seems to be a tremendous length of time to watch Joaquin Phoenix whimper nervously (it should be noted that Phoenix is great as always in a role only he could play). But, the episodic nature of the Odysseduen tale keeps it moving along. Your mileage may vary on how many of the sequences work, mine certainly did. The film’s first quarter, which may as well have been titled “The Urban Neighborhood As Seen On Fox News,” works better for me than much of the rest. While there may be parts that lag a bit, or are too weird by half, the movie shifts from sequence to sequence quickly, always introducing new ideas which each include their own wholly original quirks. For better or worse, there isn’t another movie that crams this much lunacy and creativity into its runtime.</p>

        <h2>9. Anatomy of a Fall (Justine Trier)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
                <img src="https://beverlyhillscourier.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Anatomy-of-a-Fall.1-1200x580.jpg"/>

        <p>Often people speak of “personal truths” these days, and in a twisted way ‘Anatomy of a Fall’ is about the quest to find personal truths. It’s about the truths we must believe in order to live with ourselves, or perhaps it’s really the lies that we must tell ourselves to carry on. The film asks what are the truths that we can live with, and what are those that we cannot. It’s a classic “did they do it or not” courtroom drama, but the central questions become as much about what the defendant believes about herself and her marriage as what actions she may or may not have taken. Sandra Huller is dynamic as the defendant, rendering a complex and evolving character through a trilingual performance. It has the intensity of a psychological thriller, but here the suspense is driven by what new truths each witness will speak (and how the defendant reacts) rather than by any threats lying in the shadows. ‘Anatomy of a Fall’ is undeniably a thought-provoking film that demands discussion. Plus, there’s the bonus fun of seeing the lunacy of a French courtroom on full display (although I’m sure many a French lawyer would feel the same way about American courts)</p>

        <h2> 8. Killers of The Flower Moon (Martin Scorcese)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
                <img src="https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/killers-of-the-flower-moon-01-1-1280x532.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>I personally haven’t been the biggest fan of Scorcese’s last decade. Despite retirement home epilogues and crimes being committed on Wall Street rather than Main Street, his recent movies have seemed like more of the same, pale imitations of his past work. What makes ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ stand out is how distinctive it is. It still examines the nature of American evil and greed, but it is now laced with racism and reckons with America’s original sin, all the while being set far from the streets of New York where so many of Scorcese’s masterpieces take place. It explores the grief and suffering that comes with loss; loss of a way of life, and of life itself.</p>
        <p>Lily Gladstone’s Mollie is the emotional centerpiece of the film in a weighty and subtle performance. Gladstone’s presence can be felt even when she is absent from the screen, like a black hole that pulls on everything around it even as it remains hidden. The film is not without flaws, in particular a second hour that falls back into Scorcese’s passions (buffoonish criminals) and loses sight of Mollie and the Osage. However, it’s a testament to how effective the film’s first hour is in articulating the pain of the Osage people, that a 2nd act which focuses more on the oppressors than the oppressed doesn’t diminish the way we feel that pain. The film’s final scene acknowledges the continued injustice that comes with white men being the ones who are allowed to tell this story, a fitting capstone that is the film’s most original, most distinctive and perhaps most vital scene.</p>

        <h2>7. Boy and the Heron (Hayao Miyazaki)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
                <img src="https://i0.wp.com/wrongeverytime.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/July06132543.jpg?resize=1920%2C1080&ssl=1"/>
        </figure>
        <p>The latest of Miyazaki’s “final” films has all of his trademarks that make him one of the finest filmmakers ever. While it lingers in the “real” world longer than some of his other films, it does finally weave its way into a bespoke fantasy like those that made Miyazaki famous. Murderous anthropomorphic parakeets abound in a fully realized world which we are just peeking in on. Miyazaki never holds the audience’s hand too tightly, allowing us to become absorbed in fantastical realms without needing to understand precisely how everything fits together. </p>
        <p>The original title for the film, “How Do You Live,” was probably more apt, as the film seeks to understand the difficult choices people (human or otherwise) must make to survive in a cruel and indifferent world. Miyazaki is always asking the audience to understand how others live, and why they live that way. The desire to understand and accept others is one of the eternal themes across his work. Well that and environmentalism, and as always ‘The Boy and the Heron’ has more nuance than a pure propaganda piece for protectionism. The film explores equilibrium versus rapid change, and the potential hardships that the latter can bring. If this is truly Miyazaki’s final film, it’s a great one to go out on, filled with warmth and kindness, mystery and intrigue, creativity and beauty.</p>

        <h2> 6. The Killer (David Fincher)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
                <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWFhYWM4MGMtNGEwOC00NjU3LWJmNDItZWZhNmM5ODYzZTBjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg"/>

        <p>In a world where incompetence seems increasingly omnipresent (from the highest levels of government on down), the appeal of “competency porn” becomes more widespread. This is the delight we get in watching a professional doing their job well. A delight that can even come from viewing a criminal do their job well, or even say, a hitman. And a lot of the fun that comes from ‘The Killer’ is this competency porn, we see the eponymous, yet unnamed, Killer (Michale Fassbender) work through his plans with few insights to where it is going. Simple task after simple task that slowly builds to a clever payoff as the plan comes to fruition. All the while, Fassbender’s endless monologue articulates his ideology about his profession, work ethos and lifestyle in general, treating his opinions about society as indisputable facts. However, what starts to become clear is the competency at the heart of this ‘competency porn’ is lacking. The Killer makes mistakes, both obvious and subtle, and continually breaks his personal covenants. And that’s the joke at the center of the film, for all his processes, plans and tools, The KIller is extremely fallible; yes clever and capable, yet overconfident all the same. ‘The Killer’ gives us the thrills of watching a competent professional and mocks them for their overabundant self-belief, both having its cake and eating it. </p>

        <h2>5. The Taste of Things (Tran Anh Hung)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
                <img src="https://cdn.theasc.com/Taste-of-Things-Lighter-PHOTO-7-N-1.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Joy, beauty and the love of life are not themes abundantly covered in movies, especially movies that are considered great. These themes are not those that facilitate conflict and conflict is the heart of any good story. The Taste of Things is an exception to this rule. The delights of the film come from the decadence displayed in our love for food. The elaborate recipes entertain both as stomach-growl inducing food porn, and as a hilarious commentary of our love for food and the lengths we go to satisfy it. The gorgeous cinematography matches the beauty of the food, beatifying not just the meals but the characters and their surroundings in a French countryside estate. It’s a film that entertains through joy, a lot to look at and laugh at.</p>
        <p>It follows a group of friends who are essentially foodies, albeit in the 19th century. Instead of lining up at an instagram-famous hole in the wall, they will run dishes they find delicious across the valley so their friends can try them. They are led by a gourmet Dodin, a self-assured evaluator of good taste. Where there is conflict in the film, it comes from Dodin’s attempts to court his long-time cook Eugenie. But this is a soft conflict, a subtle romance based on shared love that builds up slowly, no love triangles or messy fights in this “rom com”. Films about joy are hard to make great, it takes a deep understanding of what makes us happy to succeed. </p>

        <h2>4. Past Lives (Celine Song)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
                <img src="https://popculturemaniacs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/past-lives-different-paths.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>‘Past Lives’ shares much with the multiverse stories that have become so common, despite this somber and sentimental romance seeming to have few surface-level similarities with those sci-fi adventures. Yet, at its heart, ‘Past Lives’ seeks to explore the paths not taken in life, how someone’s life could have turned out remarkably different with a few divergent choices. It’s a reflection on how we examine our personal histories, thinking through our memories in an attempt to see how things could have turned out differently.</p>
        <p>‘Past Lives’ seems to be the most universally praised movie of the year, all who have seen it have only positive things to say about it. Perhaps it’s the universally relatable themes of introspection on our choices in life. The title refers to rebirth and reincarnation within the film’s text, but the past lives can as easily refer to the other lives we could have lived with different choices; or the past periods in our lives, and how foreign they seem to where we end up. A flawless, beautiful and somber film, it’s impossible to not be moved by ‘Past Lives’.</p>

        <h2>3. How To Blow Up A Pipeline (Daniel Goldhaber)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
                <img src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline-movie.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>‘How To Blow Up A Pipeline’ is a truly rare film, perhaps singularly rare. It’s a tightly-woven thriller that is based on an academic text filled with political-environmental theories. The film unfolds as a breathtaking thrillride, with edge-of-your-seat action and inclusive of all the sequences that come with any great heist film: assembling the team, planning & preparation, executing the plan, and the final twist. Except these sequences culminate in an act of ecoterrorism rather than a heist.</p>
        <p>Throughout this perfectly-executed thriller the theories that inspired the film are given voice. The film gives equal creedence to different versions of the American experience (urban and rural, rich and poor, right and left), while pulling them together through the unifying force of environmental preservation. And if there is a message that is core to this film it’s that the environmental threats we now face (both global and local) are perhaps the one unifying force across all of humanity. The dichotomy is what makes this film special; the thriller and the treatise on environmental theory, a film that borrows as much from ‘Ocean’s Eleven’ as from the environmental theories that act as its source material.</p>

        <h2>2. The Zone of Interest (Jonathan Glazer)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
                <img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HcXl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F503ed977-64a0-46e0-971c-a92d762295c4_1920x1005.jpeg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>‘The Zone of Interest’ is perhaps the least commercial Oscar nominee ever. An artsy, narrative-less Holocaust drama doesn’t exactly scream mainstream popularity. Especially as the camera never points itself directly at the atrocity, instead we only hear faint gunshots or see smoke rising in the distance as we watch the quaint family life of Auschwitz’s commandant. The family blissfully go about their lives without any concern for what is happening on the other side of the camp wall, while we the audience cannot escape thinking about what’s on the other side of that wall. Film, as a visual medium, is extremely well-suited to juxtaposition, and in that way this film contrasts the ordinary upper-class family life with the genocide occuring just beyond the confines of the screen. Lacking the context of the film’s setting, the actual plot (for what little there is) seems insignificant; it’s silly and largely uninteresting. It’s the context that juxtaposes that simple family life, and the disassociation required to live it, where the film’s brilliance is showcased. While this film is grounded in a very specific time and place, the message is enduring. The way that people can ignore terrible events by disassociating from them and dehumanizing the victims is sadly as relevant today as ever.</p>

        <h2>1. Oppenheimer (Christopher Nolan)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
                <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gf-07748-msg-64c39347bee6b.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>‘Oppenheimer’ is perhaps the greatest film about science ever made. And it’s not due to the actual science on display, only as much is explained as is necessary to the story. Instead, it’s the way that the film examines how science exists within society: theory vs. practice, the pure pursuit of scientific knowledge vs. applying that knowledge to the benefit (or detriment) of society; who gets to make the decisions about how theory is applied; how politics infects science; how science is driven forward by diverse perspectives and held back by those prejudices that silo humanity. And Nolan chooses perhaps the most important and devastating of scientific discoveries through which to examine this interplay between science, politics and society. </p>
        <p>Nolan's signature rapid editing lends the film a propulsive momentum despite the nearly ubiquitous conversations about scientific theory and geopolitics; the only way a film like this could make nearly $1 billion at the box office. The editing creates a crosscutting tapestry that transcends the interwoven timelines, tying together and contrasting disparate moments in a lifetime. Despite the relentless pace, the film finds small moments of profound meaning, which is largely a credit to a phenomenal ensemble. It’s a story driven as much by personal rivalries and egos as it is by the momentous scientific advancement at its core, and the existential consequences it unleashed.</p>
