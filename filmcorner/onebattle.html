        <p>I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a film receive the immediate, universal and sensational critical acclaim that One Battle of Another has. Heralded as the movie of the year by many, and even the movie of the decade by some. An all-time classic, a masterpiece, in real-time.</p>
        <p>Now, it has some built-in advantages that perk up the ears of critics and fans alike. It stars one of, if not the, biggest stars in the world in Leonardo Dicaprio. It’s also directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the once wunderkind director whose fans overlap perfectly with film bro culture.</p>
        <p>And the film itself is deserving of high praise. It’s wildly entertaining and thematically rich. Deadpan humor that is specific to a cutting edge. Thrilling scene after thrilling scene leading up to a car chase like none other. It’s literally sex, drugs and rock n roll. And for the themes, it strikes at the heart of radicalization in today’s world. Is it our values that make us who we are, or some other innate need? Do revolutionaries fight the power because of their progressive values, or is it in search of adventure (or sex in the case of Tyrena Taylor’s Perfidia Beverly Hills)? Do enforcers of the criminal justice system do so out of a drive to maintain law & order, or is it to find a sense of belonging, to earn respect, to obtain a position of power?  OBAA is about the drive to make a better world, even if that effort is doomed in the face of overwhelming authority. And the costs that this effort will bear on those driving change as they are cursed to fight “one battle after another.”</p>
        <p>The film has all of PTA’s hallmarks, if more mature than in his early years. His camera swoops and glides through the film like it always does, but now feeling less showy and more effortless. He gets memorable performances from every actor, from the big stars to the smallest of one-scene characters. The attention to detail is immaculate, and the soundtrack sublime from Johnny Greenwood’s unique voice as a composer shining through to every perfectly-timed needle drop.</p>
        <p>All that said, the biggest reason that many have praised this as the movie of the decade may be how rooted it is in the here and now. The film wrapped principal photography over a year ago, well before the election was decided, but it’s a movie that is fully ingrained in 2025. The middle third of the movie all takes place during an active and expansive ICE raid. At its heart, OBAA is a movie about Antifa vs. ICE as much as anything else. Freedom versus control. And it definitely caters to a leftist perspective, catnip for young progressives that make up the key cinema-going audience beyond family and IP blockbusters.</p>
        <p>Another of my favorite movies of the year is Eddington, and like Eddington, One Battle After Another has a lot to say about radicalization, modern political paranoia and dogmatic progressivism. But the way that One Battle After Another does so with subtlety and clarity of message rises far above the muddled mess of Eddington’s both side nihilism. Eddington’s “hit you over the head” obviousness fades in the face of OBAA’s restrained but effective commentary to the point that OBAA has caused my estimation of Eddington to drop significantly.</p>
        <p>One Battle After Another is a film about paranoia, not just by depicting paranoid people, but by putting the paranoias of both the right and left on screen. Leftist movements operate as violent, organized and capable insurgencies, and illegal immigrants are hidden behind every door. The right-wing runs the government and corporate america through white supremecist cabals, and military police kidnap and murder US citizens without restraint. The movie cuts into the challenges and divisions in modern progressivism. The aging leftist who aspires to maintain their “woke” credentials but cannot fully grasp the cultural faultlines of today. The young leftist who is too hung up on specific wording to get anything done or communicate important information.</p>
        <p>The film’s portrayal of many of its characters can come across as comical to the point of caricature. Dicaprio’s Ghetto Pat is an over the hill hippie who is constantly lighting up a joint. Sean Penn’s Colonel Lockjaw is a stiff-walking macho man with suppressed questions about his own sexuality. The aforementioned cabal titles itself the Christmas Adventurers Club who hail Saint Nick at the beginning and end of every meeting. It’s all very silly, but at least in the case of Pat and Lockjaw, it’s also remarkable the rich depth that the actors can add to their performances within these surface-level caricatures. Penn’s Lockjaw is particularly compelling. Dicaprio is great, and completely disappears in the character, but it’s a character that is somewhat easy to understand: a young radical turned burnt-out but loving father. It’s Lockjaw’s mess of conscious and subconscious desires that keeps my brain spinning. I’m sure I will be finding new insights about Lockjaw’s psychology every time I watch the film in the years to come.</p>
        <p>As comical as Lockjaw and the Christmas Adventurers Club are, the film is not without its truly terrifying villain. That comes in the form of Lockjaw’s number two, Colonel Danvers, played by James Rateman, a former Homeland Security operative. It’s frighteningly real the way that Danvers emotionlessly wields draconian prison terms as a cudgel, pressuring captives to turn on their friends and family. It’s a cold blast of reality in a film that is often outlandish by choice. And a necessary one. It’s very easy to picture hundreds of Danvers working in the criminal justice system, perhaps because the actor was once one himself.</p>
        <p>If there’s a true hero to the film it’s definitely not Dicaprio’s bumbling Pat, who cannot get out of his own way and needs to be rescued again and again. It could be Benicio Del Toro’s Sergio, a zen community leader who operates an underground railroad for undocumented migrants. He offers quiet resistance that is juxtaposed with the loud revolution practiced by the film’s other radicals. He is not motivated by a quest for glory, power or sex. He does what he does because it is the right thing to do. Helping others silently without violence, so as not to draw attention and hurt the movement.</p>        
        <h3>SPOILERS FOR THE FINAL SCENES, FAIR WARNING:</h3>
        <p>Or is the true hero Perfidia and Pat’s daughter Willa (Chase Infiniti). She is probably the protagonist of this story, the one who is doomed to carry on the fight, inheriting it from her parents. The film’s final scene seems heroic and hopeful as Willa drives off to join a protest with American Girl blasting throughout the theater. But it seemed bittersweet, if not downright depressing, to me in view of the film’s climatic confrontation a few minutes earlier. When Willa is forced to gun down a cleaner (hitman) sent by the Adventurers Club she is breaking a seal, she is now a killer, infected by the violence that infected her parents as both victim and perpetrator. After becoming a killer, she unleashes a guttural and tragic scream. Her parents have poisoned her from the moment she was born, dooming her with violence that can never be escaped. She seems closer to her father in the final scene, they can now see eye to eye through their shared participation in the rebellion. But, in joining the rebellion Willa is now cursed to fight one battle after another in the undying war that is the pursuit of freedom and equality against injustice and control.</p>
