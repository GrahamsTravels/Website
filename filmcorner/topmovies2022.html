        <h2>10) Aftersun (Charlotte Wells)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTkYQj3vy7d6dymIUVOOHpCKkSByu7JdABrkg&s"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Aftersun plays out through the vague memories of a young girl on a vacation with her father. Some aspects are incredibly fleshed out, others sparsely so as befitting the fuzziness that comes with the distance of time. Particularly fuzzy is the father, at least in the depths of his emotions. And there is a great truth in that, in how parents will not fully open up to their children, especially young children, protecting them from emotions they aren’t old enough to understand. And yet, children can always grasp a sense of something being amiss. Aftersun is a beautiful and subtle film, both authentic and surreal, and at its heart it is about how we struggle with the ghosts of past and present as we try to disentangle faint memories in search of clarity for things we now know to be true.</p>

        <h2>9) Emily The Criminal (John Patton Ford)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://www.rogerebert.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Emily-the-Criminal.jpeg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Emily The Criminal feels like a movie out of another era, like a tight, gritty 70s crime thriller. The film makes us root for the eponymous protagonist not through manipulative pulling on the heart strings but by making us understand how her desperation and world-view drives her to crime. We empathize with Emily because her frustrations with society and its unjust burdens seem completely valid, and because Aubrey Plaza's tough demeanor is impossible not to root for. The film is a perfect example of a small-scale, high-stakes thriller. The crimes may be small but the stakes are life and death and every tense scene pulls your heart into your throat. The film feels very modern by rooting Emily’s motivations in workforce struggles specific to millennials. The deft criticisms of unpaid internships or student loans could find themselves at home on r/antiwork. Maybe Emily The Criminal is a sign of a return to these small-scale crime thrillers of the 70s, as the economic conditions of today seem closer and closer to the hardships of the 70s, small-scale criminals may become more and more sympathetic protagonists. </p>

        <h2>8) The Northman (Robert Eggers)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://i0.wp.com/popculturemaniacs.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/the-northman-raid.jpg?fit=800%2C408&ssl=1"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Robert Eggers has created the “anti-action movie.” Most movies filled with action and battles do so to entertain, even if these scenes are often violent, they are still meant to spark enjoyment rather than horror. Eggers takes a different direction, his Viking revenge epic stays tonally true to the era and subject matter involved. In another film, Viking raids and battles would come across as thrilling adventures, yet in Eggers’ hands the violence repels the audience with its brutality. It is not so much gratuitous as it is gruesome in its banality, in how practiced these vicious acts are. This ruthlessly authentic depiction of violence triggers grimaces rather than grins, and makes the audience wonder what it says about them that they look to be entertained by the violent action of historical epics. Despite the strength of these introspective themes, The Northman’s plot and characters can seem more monotonous than intriguing for much of the runtime. Instead, it’s the visuals that make the film shine as Eggers crafts images out of light and shadow that seem like myth and legends come to life. It doesn’t reimagine Norse sages as much as it gives an honest depiction of the unending cycles of revenge and violence that they include. The Northman isn’t a film that I would describe as “fun,” but it does force us to reflect on what exactly we find “fun” about action epics.</p>

        <h2>7) Marcel The Shell With Shoes On (Dean Fleischer Camp)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/toonkel-3.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>It takes a lot of skill to take a series of short YouTube videos about a stop-motion shell and turn it into a feature-length movie complete with a full plot and nuanced character arcs, but somehow Dean Fleischer Camp and Jenny Slate have accomplished exactly that. The film delivers with both its journey and its destination. The journey is about finding joy within the small things in life. At the film’s heart is the kind innocence of Slate’s Marcel as he shows off the many little tools and tricks he has for living in a small world rendered large. There is a childlike wonder in Marcels’ shy observations about society’s peculiar aspects, and his realizations about the massive scale of our world. And it leads up to perhaps the most uplifting ending of the year (I hope it’s not too much of a spoiler that the movie about the stop motion snail has a happy ending).</p>

              <h2>6) Top Gun: Maverick (Joseph Kosinski)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/top-gun.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Sometimes a movie is just meant to be entertaining; there doesn’t need to be a deeper meaning or social commentary within the film’s themes, instead it just wants to put a smile on your face. And in that regard, Top Gun: Maverick succeeds on every level. The key to a great action set-piece isn’t extravagant special effects or pure speed, it’s about how the film sets up the stakes and delivers, communicating everything clearly to the audience.The climax of Maverick is a 40 minute edge-of-your-seat thrill ride that is perfectly executed by Kosinski and team. Every time the planes turn, tension rises as we know what the risks in play are; these little elements are far more impactful than just shoving a bunch of cgi on the screen (take notes Marvel). While the climatic set-piece is the crown jewel at the center of Top Gun: Maverick, the rest of the film is filled to the brim with effortless fun, in no small part to the undying charisma of our last true movie star: Tom Cruise. Despite the cheesiness, the emotional beats are effective, especially the loving tribute to Val Kilmer. There is probably not a film this year that fully succeeds in its intention to the degree that Top Gun: Maverick does, providing an enjoyable thrill ride with a climax that could compete for the Mt. Rushmore of action set-pieces.</p>

        <h2>5) Hit the Road (Panah Panahi)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWI2MmY2ZDMtYjU2Zi00NzM3LWE2YmItMzk3MjE4ZDI1ODlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Hit The Road starts like any road-trip movie would with minor gags, inconsequential arguments and slight inconveniences. Yet, there is something slightly off under the surface, something that the parents and elder son are aware of, but that the audience is as naive towards as the younger son. The film is patient as it slowly envelops the audience, dropping little hints with off-hand statements or slight looks filled with sadness. Rayan Sarlak is a revelation as the younger brother, his naivety remains intact even as the audience slowly picks up on the true meaning behind this family trip. There is an anticipation and fear of tremendous change that hangs over the whole film. It’s tough to say too much about Hit The Road without spoiling anything, and how the film unfolds is key to its impact, so I’ll just say I highly, highly recommend it. </p>

             <h2>4) Everything Everywhere All At Once (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
                <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTCmwt0zkdG8p4ihxr83qiHC1oD7Y5zer8J0g&s"/>                
        </figure>
        <p>There aren’t a lot of stones left unturned in the world of film, with over a century to go by most stories have been told before. Yet, there is still some room for truly original concepts to come forward, especially when blending together a mix of genres and ideas. EEAAO succeeds as a high-minded sci-fi adventure, a slapstick comedy, a kung-fu action flick and an emotional family drama in unison. Multiverses are very in vogue right now, on display even in the world’s biggest franchise, but it is clear as day that EEAAO presents its complex concepts in a far more nuanced and interesting way than that aforementioned IP monolith. The whole cast is great, with Michelle Yeoh at its core, and Ke Huy Quan and Stephanie Hsu providing more challenging but no less brilliant performances, playing several characters rather than a single one. Exposition for a sci-fi film with complicated ideas on its mind is never easy, but EEAAO handles it well without ever boring us. The film keeps us engaged with joke-filled action set pieces throughout its first half as it introduces the intricate sci-fi concepts at its core. And this is all to set up the breathtaking finale as the film culminates in a cross-dimensional action climax interwoven with an emotional lament about lives not lived. EEAAO may be reliant on shock humor at times and include an overly sentimental finale, but a film this new and fresh can be forgiven for some minor missteps.</p>

          <h2>3) Triangle of Sadness (Ruben Ostlund)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
                <img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e28dd3f4009cd1d7479cce02b16fa4ddbceec14/2870_351_11327_6799/master/11327.jpg?width=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=720e6ba75e5efe155c0125efae27b1aa"/>                
        </figure>
        <p>Ruben Ostlund can take a bit of a maximalistic approach to filmmaking in that he will include any idea he has for a movie, no matter how whacky, bizarre or indulgent it is. The result may come across as messy and chaotic, and to a degree it is (this movie definitely has its fill of chaos), but this is a film that thrives on how many ideas it manages to throw at the audience rather than through a tightly-written script lacking any rough edges. There are non-stop laughs to be had here, as long as anything from awkward tension to gross slapstick can make you giggle. Ostlund has a lot to say about power dynamics, especially the power dynamics between social classes, and the way that those in power can remain blissfully (and conveniently) unaware of these dynamics until the situation is thrown upside down. He portrays power, and the way it enticingly corrupts, as the true source of bad actions rather than the devious nature of individuals. Ostlund practically forces the characters, and perhaps the audience as well, to try on someone else’s pair of shoes and shift perspectives, brazenly asking questions of how they would behave given the circumstances. Triangle of Sadness is a wild ride that Ostlund just barely controls, but it is rewarding because of the pure volume of clever and funny ideas it has to offer.</p>

        <h2>2) Nope (Jordan Peele)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
                <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQsIOkNzfFa5fnsRz1cVVtNGcPTOtpziBiVuw&s"/>                
        </figure>
        <p>With every film he makes, Jordan Peele is becoming more accomplished as a filmmaker. While his 2nd and 3rd ventures may lack the superlative-ladened script of Get Out, Peele’s mastery over the other side of filmmaking, the visual aspects of directing, gets better and better. In Nope, Peele lets the camera linger on a looming threat among the clouds, and visually articulates the oh too human response that mixes terror and wonder. Within the horror genre, sound can be as impactful as imagery, and the sound design in Nope is among the best I’ve ever heard. One particular scene combines a waterfall of bloody vomit and a cacophony of echoing screams into a blend of skin-crawling delight. Along with his rising visual (and auditory) skills, with each film Peele becomes vaguer in the themes he presents. Moving from the more direct statements about race or class relations in his earlier films, Nope has something subtler to say about the dangers of human curiosity and our unabating need to be amazed. While some audiences (and critics) seemed dismayed by the increased opaqueness of Nope, there can be more profound meaning within this subtly. </p>

        <h2>1) Tar (Todd Fields)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
                <img src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1240w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-10/221006-tar-cate-blanchett-se-512p-30d039.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>We live in a world where our inner selves and what we outwardly present to the world can often be disconnected, especially as we find ourselves increasingly interacting with the world through a digital lens. The exquisitely arranged opening sequence of Tar showcases just how artificial Lydia Tar’s external persona is; we know immediately that Lydia is a person wholly consumed with her outward image, setting us up to peel back the onion as we see her hidden peculiarities and misdeeds throughout the film, and to have an instant dislike for her so we can revel as those misdeeds come back to haunt Tar. The writing, direction and of course Cate Blanchett’s performance are as perfectly constructed as is Lydia Tar’s desired outward-facing persona. Every shot is meant to convey something to the audience, the film does not waste a moment in the subtle yet scintillating story. Blanchett perfectly flows between different visages of Tar depending on what is most expedient for the character’s goals in that moment. The fall of a seemingly great figure is not a new tale, but always one that can be fun to watch unfold, and Tar modernizes this age-old story structure for the age of cancellation. </p>
