        <h2>10) Uncut Gems (Safdie Brothers)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">

        <p>You can break a film down into its attempt (what the film is trying to do or convey) and its execution (how successful it is at achieving whatever it attempts to do). Uncut Gems attempts to stress the audience out for the duration of its 2+ hours, and by all accounts it succeeds. Watching Howie (Adam Sandler) jump from one gamble to another while avoiding loan sharks is stressful enough, but the Safdie brothers contribute to the accelerated heart rate with extreme close-ups, a neurotic synth soundtrack and overlapping dialogue. But for all the film craft that is used to ramp up the stress, it needs to be asked if it is worth ramping up the stress to begin with. Uncut Gems is undoubtedly well executed, but is it an attempt worth making? The film ranks as one of the best of the year because it is undoubtedly a well-made movie, but it seems like a movie made because the directors asked if they could rather than if they should bother.</p>

        <h2>9) Little Women (Greta Gerwig)</h2>

        <p>The story of Little Women is certainly not new to the big screen as the 2019 version joins a long line of remakes. However, Greta Gerwig does enough to make the story current to justify this version. Perhaps the most interesting way that Gerwig updates the story is weaving together several timelines to great success and emotional payoff. By placing related scenes that may take place years apart adjacently in the film, Gerwig drives home how a single moment in life may have years of buildup. While the pacing feels too quick at times, the film does well to economically move through the 800 page novel without ever dropping clarity. Gerwig has definitely staked her claim as one of the emerging auteurs of Hollywood, joining the likes of Jordan Peele (see above) and Barry Jenkins.</p>

        <h2>8) Us (Jordan Peele)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://media.wired.com/photos/5c93de9833eb236ab0dd6704/4:3/w_2400,h_1800,c_limit/Culture_UsReview_Lupita4.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Jordan Peele’s follow-up to Get Out builds on his reputation as one of the emerging directorial talents of the day. Us maintains the same brilliant concept as the earlier film, building a social metaphor into a horror film; this time he turns the focus to social class and income inequality. Us is a messier film than Get Out, lacking the tight script or clear messaging of the previous. However, while Us presents a vaguer metaphor, in some ways this is to the film’s benefit. There is more to unpack and discuss in trying to discern what exactly Peele has to say this time. Peele's directorial skill has developed as he heightens the tension of Us and provides some brilliantly arranged shots.</p>

        <h2>7) Booksmart (Olivia Wilde)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">

        </figure>
        <p>Probably the most laughs per minute of the year, proving that comedy is not yet dead in the PC era. Booksmart follows the crazy 24 hours in high school model of past great films such as Dazed and Confused and Superbad. It is not the most original concept, but a Gen Z slant keeps it feeling current and fresh. First-time director Olivia Wilde adds some fun film-making flair that makes the trials and tribulations of high school hit home. The film does cross-clique interactions as well as any movie post-Mean Girls. Booksmart is not the best high school movie ever made, but it sure is one of the funniest.</p>

        <h2>6) Knives Out (Rian Johnson)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">

        </figure>
        <p>Knives Out tells a funny & exciting whodunnit. The film introduces some clever spins on this tired genre, but Knives Out’s true genius comes from the way it depicts a dysfunctional family. Wise grandfathers, angry uncles and rebellious cousins all would seem at home in any family. The entire cast is phenomenal in bringing the various eccentric, yet recognizable, characters to life. The film was released right around Thanksgiving and at its essence it is about the American family, even as the American family becomes increasingly dysfunctional in the age of political divisiveness.</p>

        <h2>5) Joker (Todd Phillips)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f18/557/6b67c2fbc754d161f9d10b4f4cb42da70a-17-joker-faq.rsocial.w1200.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Joker is a good film, if not a great one. Despite this being a middle-of-the-road opinion, it may be a hot take as this film is beloved by some and decried by others. It checks all the boxes for a good film, if not shining through in any incredible way. It is visually striking and smartly written, but in ways that are derivative of Martin Scorsese’s early work. It provides social commentary about mental health and isolation, but not in a particularly profound or deep way. It offers a powerhouse Joaquin Phoenix performance, but one that is not even among his five best. On the flip side, some truly despise this film which seems too far for a film whose missteps are pretty superficial (e.g. forced inclusion of a young Bruce Wayne to fit into the DC continuity). Maybe the passionate hatred for this film in some circles stems from an inability to separate the film from its fanbase. Those fanboys who miss the point of Joker, treating its central character with idolization rather than a mix of pity and fear.</p>

        <h2>4) Luce (Julius Onah)</h2>

        </figure>
        <p>What happens when an adopted child soldier turned valedictorian raises the suspicions of an over-involved teacher? Well for one thing, you get the best physiological thriller of the year. Clouded motives, dubious ethical choices and morally grey characters leaves the viewer questioning where they stand on all that unfolds. Luce is not an easily solved film, leaving plenty of room for thought and discussion after viewing. Kelvin Harrison Jr’s Luce and Octavia Spencer’s Ms. Wilson do battle in a sea of passive aggressive, tense conversations as the film brings current themes such as tokenism, privacy and censorship to the forefront.</p>

        <h2>2) Marriage Story (Noah Baumbach)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/191103110229-marriage-story-netflix.jpg?c=original&q=w_860,c_fill"/>
        </figure>
        <p>The way that a loving marriage can transition to a seemingly amicable divorce to something nasty and destructive is explored in nuanced and slow detail. Noah Baumbach arranges fantastic sequences and shots that succinctly depict the traumatic warping of how two people feel about each other. Brilliant scenes demonstrate the disconnect between divorcees living through the worst experience of their lives and divorce lawyers at any old day at the office. The film is not without flaws; despite efforts to be fair to all sides, Baumbach cannot help but focus more on the male perspective and some attempts at comedy feel mistimed and out of place. Nevertheless, Marriage Story is a gut-crunching depiction of the family unit ripped apart.</p>

        <h2>1) Parasite (Bong Joon-Ho)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://filmoblivion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sc-parasite9.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Over the past summer, it seemed whenever I caught up with someone I hadn’t seen in a while we would spend at least a few minutes venting about what a mess the final season of Game of Thrones was. The opposite happened this fall and early winter when every time I see someone for the first time in a while we would excitedly discuss how great Parasite is. There are a lot of reasons that Parasite is the best movie of 2019: Bong Joon-Ho direction includes brilliant shot after brilliant shot, the masterful script is wholly unique and cross-culturally relevant, the entire cast provide fantastic performances. However, perhaps the most succinct reason is that it is the most talked-about, exciting and interesting film of the year.</p>
