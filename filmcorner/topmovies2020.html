        <h1>The Ten Best Movies of 2020</h1>
       </div> 
       <p>2020 was a strange year in just about every regard, and film is no exception. The overall quality of films this year may be a bit lower, probably because less movies came out overall. Or maybe not being able to see a film on the big screen means it can never have the same impact. Regardless, this year lacks a true masterpiece from what I have seen, but there is plenty of good stuff that came out.</p>
       <p>I definitely did not see all the films that I wanted to and less than I would see in a normal year. Not being able to go to theaters took away some of my access or drive to see 2020’s best films. I’m sure months or years down the line, I will realize that there are at least a couple movies that I would add to this list that I did not see in time, but alas, so it is.</p>
       <p>My top 10 is a pretty varied list, by my count I’ve got 4 dramas, 1 thriller, 1 western, 1 action-adventure film, 1 sci-fi film, 1 comedy and 1 documentary. Yet, despite this diverse range, I saw some links between them, both in similarities and differences.</p>
       <p>For two of the best films of the year I would almost describe them as ‘patriarchal horror.’ One is a straight-up thriller about escaping from an abusive relationship (The Invisible Man) and the other I could call horror in the guise of a workplace drama (The Assistant) that is a subtle display of the constricting nature of misogyny in the workplace.</p>
       <p>Two of my favorites are a pair of weird films that are not without their flaws and probably a bit too violent (Da 5 Bloods & Bacurau). And yet, I loved every minute of these movies and am more eager to revisit them than any others I saw this year.</p>
       <p>The year’s best documentary tells its story in such an effective and direct manner that it feels like a narrative film (Collective). And one of the year’s best dramas is so authentic it is essentially a documentary in many ways (Nomadland).</p>
       <p>Incredibly, two of this year’s best films are both courtroom dramas that stem from protests turned riots (Mangrove and Trial of the Chicago 7). Two films so rooted in our current historical moment that it seems impossible that these films both entered production before June 2020. One is a flashy affair with crisp dialogue and crafty editing. The other uses small moments of humanity to build a greater narrative. With two films so similar, I did not feel I had room for both. So, I chose the stark realism of Mangrove over the Hollywood preaching of Trial of the Chicago 7.</p>

        <h2>10) Mangrove (Steve Mcqueen)</h2>

        <p>Steve McQueen (best known for 12 Years a Slave) has once again cemented himself as a directorial giant in the film industry. Mangrove is brilliant in the way that small moments stand in for larger ideas, enabling it to tell a complex and sprawling story efficiently. A single colander slowly rolls on the ground after a police raid on a restaurant, a lasting image of this quick and ruthless injustice. A cop is questioned on the stand by a black defendant and we see his fingers scratch harshly into the wood. The muted anger of his bigotry rings loud in such a quick shot. Mangrove adapts history to the screen by using small moments like these to piece together a larger story about race, justice and 1960s London. It also stays true to reality as McQueen knows that the truth is powerful on its own and no manipulation towards crowd-pleasing cliches or overt messaging is necessary or warranted.</p>

        <h2>9) Collective (Alexander Nanau)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/collective-e1570107850149.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Just the facts. Maybe that's all we can ask for from a documentary. And that is exactly what Collective delivers. The film follows a team of investigative journalists that dig into widespread corruption within the Romanian healthcare system. We learn the facts as they do, following their investigation step by step. The story is told simply, we see real conversations by the different players involved. We sit in meeting rooms, cars and press conferences with reporters as they work through the story. No narrators or talking heads are needed. This a procedural that is peerless is its access and efficiency. Collective is the best documentary I saw last year and its pacing is so economical and effective that it almost feels like you are watching a narrative film. A perfect example of story-telling through editing the right moments into a film.</p>

        <h2>8) Emma (Autumn de Wilde)</h2>

        <p>Emma may not be the deepest, most interesting or most original movie of the year, but damn if it is not one of the most fun. It is fun to listen to with the entire cast having great control over Jane Austen's fast & funny dialogue. It is fun to look at with a brilliant mix of colors filling the screen as the film offers some of the best costume & set design of the year. There are some beautiful shots of the English countryside for anyone that is a fan of rolling green hills. The film gets as much of its comedy from fast cuts and body language as it does from the dialogue. And at the center of it all is Anya Taylor-Joy who brings her cold energy to the role and continues to demonstrate her A-list movie star chops..</p>

        <h2>7) The Vast of Night (Andrew Patterson)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://film-authority.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Vast-of-Night.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>In recent years, film, as a reflection of the world overall, has made the miraculous seem mundane. Nowhere is this more true than in science fiction. With increasing CGI, spaceships, laser guns and exotic aliens flood our screens. In order to stand out, sci-fi often strives to be bigger, bolder and flashier than what has come before. The Vast of Night does not venture in this direction, instead it returns sci-fi to its roots, dealing with the unknown as something full of mystery, wonder and hope. It is low-budget sci-fi at its best. The film follows a pair of friends in a small 1950s town as they come to discover that there are visitors from beyond earth flying above their town. Without the budget for special effects, the visuals are simple. Most of the time the camera is focused on two characters, the dark night sky and radio equipment. Instead, the story is told audialy. Unidentified sounds heard in the night set an eerie tone and one of the year’s best soundtracks carries much of the emotional weight for the film. Ultimately, The Vast of Night leaves you with an overwhelming sense of awe in the face of the unknown. </p>

        <h2>6) Nomadland (Chloe Xiao)</h2>

        </figure>
        <p>Slice of life films about marginalized Americans have ranked among some of the best films of the last decade, a trend Nomadland continues. The film is intimate in its exploration of nomadic life, romanticizing it at the same time as it portrays the bleak reality of the lifestyle. The community and the loneliness, the freedom and the vulnerability, the joy and the suffering. Nomadland has some of the year’s best cinematography with shots of the vast landscapes and the stunningly colored sky that can be found in the American west. The beauty of the visuals juxtaposes the sad vanishing of the American middle class.</p>

        <h2>5) Da 5 Bloods (Spike Lee)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">

        </figure>
        <p>Da 5 Bloods is an abrupt, experimental & flawed movie that is admittedly a bit of a mess. And yet, I think it includes many of the year's 'best ofs'. The way it views the tragedy of the Vietnam War like an old scar that will never truly heal resonated with me more on a thematic level than any other film I saw this year. Delroy Lindo gives the year's most powerful performance as MAGA-hatted Paul, the year’s most intriguing character. My favorite scene of the year is the thrilling, heart-in-your-throat land-mine-infused set-piece about halfway through. It is far from a perfect film, but it is one I unapologetically love.</p>

        <h2>4) Judas and the Black Messiah (Shaka King)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sfc-datebook-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/MER6f23af6384a70b5a97103b0b6b682_stanfield0212.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Judas is an enigma of a movie, at different times a crime thriller, a tragedy, a propulsive biopic and an intimate love story. The way it effortlessly blends these diverse threads is testament to an expertly edited film that is perfectly paced. However, genre bending would be impossible without the magnificent performances from the four leads. Lakeith Stanfield, Daniel Kaluuya, Dominique Fishback and Jesse Plemons are all superb and transition between scenes that range in tone and mood with ease. Each of them portrays their role with layers of human complexity. All humans are enigmas in some way, with divergent strands of values, beliefs and behaviors. The humanity that is so effortlessly presented by the leads allows the film to live up to the complexity of the historical figures and events it is about.</p>

        <h2>3) Bacurau (Kleber Mendonça Filho, Juliano Dornelles)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/03/arts/00bacurau-1/00bacurau-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Simply said, Bacurau is a weird film. It's about an odd, rural community in a forgotten corner of the world. The residents of the eponymous village of Bacurau have no choice but to bind together in the face of threats. Most notably these threats are villainous outsiders in the form of corrupt politicians and dangerous tourists. My favorite film is Seven Samurai, so anytime you have a community coming together to take on aggressive outsiders it is always going to work for me. Bacurau zigs and zags through a maze of clichés and tropes, both playing into them and subverting them, so that it feels both familiar and unique.</p>

        <h2>2) The Inviisble Man (Leigh Whannell)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc4YzUyYTAtMzlhMi00ZDhlLTliMGMtN2I2MTNhNjAxOWQyXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>A woman is stalked by her abusive ex-boyfriend. He fakes his death to the world, but in reality he is not dead but invisible. He slowly gaslights her with little acts of manipulation that grow more and more intrusive. A very simple premise, but one that gives an opportunity for a litany of clever and memorable scenes. A breath of cold air disconnected from anyone. The imprints of shoes on a blanket where no one is standing. There are lots of great little moments in The Invisible Man. Combine these inventive scenes with some clever twists and a horror protagonist who actually behaves like an intelligent human-being and you have a powerful thriller that keeps the audience on its toes.</p>

        <h2>1) The Assistant (Kitty Green)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-assistant.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>My favorite film of the year is a masterful example of finding the right balance between being too subtle and too overt. Not too subtle to obscure its message, but not so obvious that it feels blunt. Every shot has a story to tell in The Assistant and Julia Gardner gives a powerful performance that is all about reserved small moments of body language. The Assistant has been described as a “MeToo” film, and it certainly qualifies, but the film has more on its mind than just that. It shows the way that casual cruelty can flow down from the top and create a workplace culture rooted in fear, indifference and abuse. It’s a condemnation of American work culture overall and an exploration both of how employees are abused and why that abuse is able to occur.</p>
