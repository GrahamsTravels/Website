        <h2>10) Arrival (2016) <em>Denis Villenueve</em></h2>

        <p>First contact with extraterrestrial life is usually treated as an excuse for high-budget action, it's refreshing to see a version that examines what it truly means to be ‘alien’ as it relates to something as essential to life as communication. Sci-fi in general probably needs more high-concept works like Arrival and less explosions. Arrival is a masterful example of how to adapt a complex written-work for a film version. Bringing the time-bending brilliance of Ted Chang’s Story of Your Life to the big screen takes clever writing and skillful editing. The film slowly builds to a powerful climax as the intricacies of the plot are slowly unveiled. The moment where it all comes together in Arrival is one of the great reveals in film history. </p>

        <h2>9) Spotlight (2015) <em>Tom McCarthy</em></h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://ew.com/thmb/mSC3s92KtX1gc8usyt_6bPUpWf4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spotlight-01-cddacac7f5d4424c9e470a9cbf4f249f.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>The other films on this list all have flashier visuals and writing than Spotlight; the film is structured like a simple procedural, but that is to its benefit. The story of reporters slowly uncovering the layers of corruption surrounding the Catholic Church’s rampant abuse of minors stands on its own. A weaker film would flood the script with melodrama: confrontations with priests, main characters with personal attachments to the victims, maybe even a romantic subplot or two. But Spotlight does not need any of this, the simple facts of the story are alone enough to drive an emotional response without additional melodramatic appeals. Spotlight may not stand the test of time as well as other great films of the decade, it is unlikely to be very influential and does not hold the same rewatchability. However, it is an important, impactful and harrowing watch and demands a place among the best films of the decade on that merit alone.</p>

        <h2>8) 12 Years a Slave (2013) <em>Steve McQueen</em></h2>
        <figure class="image-container">

        <p> Perhaps the most deserving Oscar winner of the decade, the film examines the depths of America’s dark past. The cast is universally stellar as despair, pain and evil of the time period is unveiled. Steve McQueen’s stellar direction controls the emotional state of the viewer, bringing them through fits of fear, hope and rage as he unpacks America’s greatest sin. 12 Years has not remained as ingrained in the public zeitgeist the way other great films of the decade have, which is unfortunate as, despite being among the most impactful events on contemporary America, slavery is underrepresented in film. Maybe one day Solomon Northrup with be the face of the Antebellum South rather than Scarlett O’Hara.</p>

        <h2>7) Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) <em>George Miller</em></h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://i.redd.it/noticed-the-sand-storm-was-eerily-similar-to-the-one-from-v0-suv5fyueq22d1.jpg?width=1192&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99febef6cb945ecf8f59e1c19c2cb96cb80cd46e"/>
        </figure>
        <p>It feels like everything that can be said about Fury Road has already been said. The film includes some of the greatest action set-pieces of all time without abandoning an emotional core. The distinctive and exotic aesthetic of Fury Road has become ingrained in the cultural zeitgeist, “it's like something out of Mad Max” is now often used to describe anything that edges on the apocalyptic chaos of the film. It is the best action movie of the decade, probably the best since at least The Matrix. Perhaps no film from the decade will remain as permanently relevant and rewatchable as Fury Road. </p>

        <h2>6) Get Out (2017) <em>Jordan Peele</em></h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://creepycatalog.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.46.52-PM-copy.jpg?w=768&h=576&crop=1"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Get Out almost feels like it arrived a couple years too late; the sly satire mocks the upper-class racism of the post-racial Obama-era rather than the overt racism of the Trump-era. However, Get Out does cut to the core of racial prejudices that still linger even among the more progressive members of society. Jordan Peele spares no one as he ruthlessly satires everything from liberal politics to sports and horror films. Peele’s directorial debut demonstrates a clear skill for weaving metaphorical social satire into a finely-tuned horror film.</p>

        <h2>5) Manchester by the Sea (2016) <em>Kenneth Lonergan</em></h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KEZ7zJvkR3I/maxresdefault.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>No film impacted me on an emotional level the way Manchester by the Sea did. The performances are the core of the film as the actors draw the viewer into the emotional-state of the characters. Casey Affleck gives the performance of the decade without over-the-top monologues. Instead, his performance is about subtlety with averted glances and signs taking the place of shouts and cries. Despite being wracked with tragedy, Manchester never feels operatic. The weight of the drama is broken by the casual humor and mild inconveniences of everyday life, mimicking how people cannot always contend with their grief without everyday life getting in the way. The film works so well on an emotional level because it delves deep into tragedy while still feeling realistic and true.</p>

        <h2>4) Mustang (2015) <em>Deniz Gamze Ergüven</em></h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/mustang-cannes-film-festival.jpg?w=1000"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Mustang is a less well-known Turkish film that follows a group of young sisters come of age rebelling against the patriarchal restrictions in Turkish society. The film does well at framing society as the true villain rather than any individuals. As the movie unfolds, patriarchy itself feels like an extra character in the way that it influences the proceedings. Mustang is exemplary of the golden rule in filmmaking:```show don't tell.” Deniz Gamze Ergüven’s direction shines through as every shot is perfectly arranged so that the viewer understands how the characters are feeling or thinking without needing to be told through dialogue. The story just flows over you, felt more than seen.</p>

        <h2>3)The Florida Project (2017)<em>Sean Baker</em></h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/the-florida-project-brooklynn-prince-4.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>The lengths that adults go to protect the innocence of children, that is ultimately what The Florida Project is about. The bubble that adults will preserve for children to protect them from the realities of living in poverty and the joy of the children in that bubble. Movies often treat their child characters like adults. They may be slightly more clueless or innocent than the adult characters, but still speak and act like an adult might. The Florida Project does not have this issue; the band of kids that form the core of the film are filled with the playful and naive innocence of actual children. Sean Baker’s film brings the camera down to their level, following the children as they run through the colorful landscape in which they play. </p>

        <h2>2) Parasite (2019) <em>Bong Joon-Ho</em></h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://www.tasteofcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kang-ho-Song-Parasite.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>A truly original concept, pitch-perfect direction, inquisitive social commentary and standout performances from across the cast; Parasite offers just about everything you would look for in a masterpiece film.  The film piles incredible scene after incredible scene so that you are fully entertained throughout. So much so that a slight reprieve in the middle of the film seems like something out of a different movie. Bong Joon-Ho winds through different genres, moving from a hilarious satire to a tense thriller to a provocative family drama. The exquisite comedic timing and cross-cultural themes made Parasite a critical and financial success in many countries, unusual for a social satire. </p>

        <h2>1) The Social Network (2010) <em>David Fincher</em></h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/f024752/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4105x2528+0+55/resize/880x542!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkpbs-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fimg%2Fphotos%2F2010%2F10%2F04%2FDF-09198r.JPG"/>
        </figure>
        <p>There might not be a film as emblematic of the decade as The Social Network. No trend dominated the 2010s like the increasing ubiquity of the internet, and The Social Network exemplifies a digital society as aptly as any film. A lightning quick pace, rapid editing and whip smart dialogue hurdles the film forward at a speed representative of life in the internet age. When The Social Network was released, society remained in a somewhat honeymoon phase with the tech giants. However, the way the film focuses on the greed, arrogance and potential for wrong-doing that surrounds Silicon Valley may seem prescient given our increasing apprehension towards big tech in the latter half of the decade.</p>
