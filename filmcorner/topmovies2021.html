        <h1>The Ten Best Movies of 2021</h1>
       </div> 
    <p>As with any attempt to rank something so subjective, my favorite films of the year are probably better viewed more as general tiers than a strict order. These films are diverse in their styles and themes, so you can never really compare apples to apples. And the last few films on the list could easily be exchanged with any of the honorable mentions. Nevertheless, my favorite movies of 2021...</p>

        <h2>10) Drive my Car (Ryusuke Hamaguchi)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8b7954a/2147483647/strip/false/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2F40%2F4e0f6f0b474aae7da87637748dfa%2Fla-ca-drive-my-car-movie-0052.JPG"/>

        <p>Drive My Car is a film that requires immense patience. It requires viewing in a theater not because it includes impressive visuals or set pieces, but because it cannot be fully enjoyed when distractions abound. It is slow in its pacing, much like Power of the Dog, but it lacks that film’s deliberately controlled direction. Instead, Drive My Car simply flows over you. Every scene that advances the plot is surrounded in quiet free space allowing each moment to be pondered and absorbed. The heart of the film is not easily identified on its surface as much of the dialogue is spent with characters telling stories to each other, or simply borrowed from Chekov’s Uncle Vanya. It's the remarkable ability of Hamaguchi and his cast to convey a rich subtext to this dialogue that lets the film’s magic work. Hamaguchi delicately examines humanity’s need for storytelling as a way to truly communicate on a deeper level.</p>

        <h2>9) A Hero (Asghar Farhadi)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5034a54/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4914x2805+37+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FYUJESUXlZk3GGhG1i6MARcSj1Nw%3D%2F0x0%3A4987x2805%2F4987x2805%2Ffilters%3Afocal%282494x1403%3A2495x1404%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F23148862%2Fa_hero_HERO_2022_UT_210610_SHOAMI_00010_rgb.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Asghar Farhadi is one of the best screenwriters working today as he consistently crafts intense moral dramas. His films are devoid of heroes and villains, despite the title of this particular film. Instead the plots are driven by conflicting self-interests, just as most of human behavior is. A Hero delivers much of the same; the story revolves around Amir Jadidi’s Rahim and his quest to find a way out of debtors' prison. The film creates immediate sympathy for Rahim, forcing the audience to become completely invested in his story, while at the same time slowly complicating that sympathy as more about Rahim is revealed. Amir Jadidi’s deeply human performance keeps us guessing about his true feelings and motivations, or if the character is even fully aware of what he is doing. The film is universal in its themes about how quick we can be to align ourselves with a cause that we deem virtuous, especially if it reflects favorably on ourselves, and also about how quick we will jump ship from said cause when it appears flawed in any way. The film is impactful in its social criticism without being preachy. It clearly shows the deep flaws in society in such a way that it is undeniable to the audience.</p>

        <h2>8) The Suicide Squard (James Gunn)</h2>

        <p>A silly, comic book movie doesn’t sound like it should be on a list of the year’s best films at first glance, but maybe we shouldn’t overlook the world’s most popular genre. The Suicide Squad embraces the weirdness of comic books and is all the better for it. Instead of an unending parade of the same bland superhero movies with the same old characters telling the same generic jokes, the movie makes interesting choices. It includes eccentric characters from the depths of irrelevant comic annals, and is dark with its humor, such as when it consistently kills off these characters suddenly for a lark. The Suicide Squad is just pure fun with clever action scenes, a likable and original cast of characters, and a zany plot that strays away from obvious expectations. And there is some substance to go along with all the fun spectacle; there is an intelligent, if somewhat overt, satire of foreign policy adventurism and the devious nature of human curiosity.</p>

        <h2>7) Dune (Denis Villeneuve)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59e512ddf43b55c29c71b996/cf535253-ceb4-4bc5-a076-4a5d6514c214/dune_2021_1.jpeg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Dune was often cited as among the most unadaptable of IP. The complex setting, lengthy plot and heavy use of inner voice as a storytelling device make it a book that cannot be fully captured on the screen. Despite these challenges, Denis Villeneuve made a bold attempt that is about as successful as anyone could hope for. The (somewhat risky) decision to split the book across two films seems necessary to effectively depict the entire plot, especially when compared to the incomprehensible mess that Lynch’s 1984 version becomes in its second half. Villeneuve is intelligent in which scenes he chooses to include, ensuring the story moves efficiently without losing any of the world building, key themes or even some of its weirder elements. Overall, Villeneuve focuses on creating a visual spectacle that expresses the vast scale of the story, ensuring the film can be enjoyed by ‘super-fans’ of the novel and those new to the universe alike. Even if not every plot point is understood by a viewer, the film is sustained by the pure visual thrills and mystical sci-fi tone.</p>

        <h2>6) The Card Counter (Paul Schrader)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/10/arts/00card-counter/merlin_194009259_c99df4d3-2a38-4e7c-b128-b444fe7c34c8-superJumbo.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>The Card Counter melds two vastly different concepts into one as it explores both the fun world of professional poker, and on the less fun side, the depths of human trauma. Despite this contrast, both sides of the film work well. Oscar Isaac’s narration walks us through the tricks and peculiarities that arise in the life of a pro-gambler. There is a certain thrill to being introduced to a niche environment through the eyes of an expert, the little insights that seem so obvious after hearing them but are novel nonetheless. Isaac gives the performance of the year as a man racked with guilt for his past sins. He tries to move through life with a calm precision, yet his face is locked in a constant grimace of stress. Paul Schrader loves to write stories about angry, repressed loners; while always interesting, these stories can be slogs at times. The fun gambling elements of The Card Counter provide a nice change of pace to break up the darker elements of the story.</p>

        <h2>5) Zola (Janicza Bravo)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/60db8ab3904d56846689030b/16:9/w_2559,h_1439,c_limit/Brody-Zola.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p> Social media is an unavoidable presence in our lives, and yet it seems underrepresented in the film industry in terms of films about social media, inspired by social media or in the tone of social media. Zola appears to be a notable step in filmmaking history both as the first film adapted from a Twitter thread, and as a film that truly embodies its social media origins. The rhythmic, rapid pacing creates a style emblematic of social media posts. Social media seethes throughout the film as it is critical to both the plot and the characters’ lives. Beyond its intriguing origins and style, Zola is notable for being perhaps the pound for pound most fun movie of the year and is worth a view on that alone. The film succeeds both with its constant laughs and its brief but intense forays into something more akin to horror.</p>

        <h2>4) The Green Knight (David Lowry)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://www.ouzelumbird.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/green-knight-hero-image.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>David Lowry created something truly different with The Green Knight, a retelling of Arthurian legends shrouded with elements of horror and impossible to completely unravel. The Green Knight recreates myths on screen by trading out realistic behavior or clever staging for the grandiose and symbolic moments that are found in the legends of old. The macabre tone infuses the whole film with a sense of impending doom. The film is filled with memorable images as each shot is deftly rendered with some of the most exquisite cinematography and production design of the year. The way it deconstructs the myths surrounding these supposedly chivalrous knights is distinctly compelling. The Green Knight is rarely clear on what it wants to say, which makes the film all the better as it leaves us with much to ponder after watching it.</p>

        <h2>3) The Power Of The Dog (Jane Campion)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://www.anothergaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PRI_210416397.jpeg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Power of the Dog is a slow burning film which takes its time to flesh out its characters and weave its story threads. Despite this slow, determined pacing, the film never lags, which is a credit to the efficiency and effectiveness of its storytelling. Every scene, even every shot, in the film is meaningful, there are no wasted moments. Jane Campion maintains a masterful control over the audience’s hearts and minds as she delivers information bit by bit. Great acting, writing and directing combine to deliver a shining example of ‘show don’t tell’. While the story isn’t as original as it would have been when the source novel was published in the 60s, the complex and fully-realized characters make this a story worth telling, and Campion could not have told it any better.</p>

        <h2>2) The French Dispatch (Wes Anderson)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UKowPatdQDV6LL97QDMvE4.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p> If you like one Wes Anderson film, you will probably like most if not all of them, as befitting the industry’s most idiosyncratic director. Even with that consistent quality of his films, The French Dispatch stands out amongst the field. Perhaps the quirky, original plots of Anderson’s films work better in the short-form vignettes of Dispatch (the film primarily consists of three short stories resembling journalistic articles) rather than when extended out across a full 2-hour run time. A big part of what makes The French Dispatch special is the writing; as with most of Anderson’s work, the dialogue is filled with witty flair, but where Dispatch really stands out is with its nearly ubiquitous narration. The exquisite monologues written in the style of long-form essays are beautifully recited by Jeffrey Wright, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton, and serve as a fitting tribute to The New Yorker.</p>

        <h2>1) Red Rocket (Sean Baker)</h2>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/61bbcff4c04331a627248f80/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Brody-RedRocket.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>As a director, Sean Baker has always been interested in the hidden parts of America, the places and people that lie within the margins. Red Rocket depicts the lonely desperation of a poor blue-collar city and the types of people that arise from it. The backgrounds of shots are filled with decrepit smokestacks, referencing the economic vibrance of a bygone era. The film follows Simon Rex’s Mikey, an aging pornstar far past his sell-by date, as he returns to his hometown. At its heart, Red Rocket is devoted to the thrills and horrors that come with watching Mikey work little schemes, leaching onto anyone that can provide him with any benefit whatsoever. But it is also about what kind of environment creates such a man. He is impatient, ego-centric and predatory because he must be in order to maintain his lively ambitions despite his background. He must be a constant schemer, a constant taker from all around him, but he also shields himself from any remorse for his actions with pure narcissism. Baker explores how people behave when their opportunities are limited, when they are pushed to the brink. He doesn’t judge his characters as much as he seeks to understand them.</p>
